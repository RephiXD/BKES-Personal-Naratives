  <h1>The Keyboard Warrior</h1>
  
  <p>The keyboard warrior. The person who hops online on a device of their choosing, scours the internet, and concocts a 10-page essay as soon as they find an opinion that contradicts their own, pushing the limits of their fingers and keyboard as if their life depended on it.</p>

  <p>I was that person once; all the conditions were also met to a T. I also happened to be fighting against another one of my kind, hell-bent on proving his point. The group chat, peaceful and quiet, was suddenly raucous, facilitating a war only fought by two people, with two peacemakers trying to calm the storm.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that we were fighting for a noble cause. We weren't talking about world politics, religion, or philosophy. Man, it wasn't even about school. It was the most simple topic: where our civics teacher had moved.</p>

  <p>"Ye, pak Calvin Bangun mau pelayanan di Sumatra, jadi mau rayain hari terakhirnya di sini"</p>

  <p>Oops. Big mistake. So, as the benevolent friends that my friend and I are, we corrected him. My friend first.</p>

  <p>"??? Sumatra? Manado bro"</p>

  <p>I chimed in. In a joking manner, of course, as I usually am.</p>

  <p>"SuLaWeSi UTaRa"</p>

  <p>But then he snapped.</p>

  <p>":v"</p>
  <p>"yaudah"</p>
  <p>"buruk burukin gw"</p>
  <p>"gpp"</p>
  <p>"gw bodoh kok"</p>
  <p>"Bodo amat"</p>
  <p>"keep telling me i'm stupid ok?"</p>

  <p>That got me pissed. I thought to myself, "This guy is getting on my nerves. We kid around like this when anyone makes a mistake, INCLUDING you, and all of a sudden you get mad? What a joke..." And that's when I decided to put dinner aside, as both of us armed ourselves with our trusty keyboards and went to war.</p>

  <p>The opening shot: "WILL YOU SHUT THAT GAPING HOLE IN YOUR FACE, MAN"</p>

  <p>Calls for peace were like a whisper in a cacophony of noises. No one was able to put an end to the whirlwind of sentences in the chat. It was like what most wars were like: Loud. Angry. Exhausting. Pointless. What could have been an amicable discussion turned into a furious words-per-minute match.</p>

  <p>The war just wouldn't die down. None of us would give in; our keyboards and fingers were at their limits. But then, what seemed to be like water came rushing in.</p>

  <p>"It's just I hate whenever he does this, this irritating tantrum of his"</p>
  <p>"Me too, but I think fighting a tantrum with another one is a bad move"</p>

  <p>It was a slap in the face. I felt so. Dumb. The right thing to do was staring right in my face, but I didn't pay it a single ounce of attention due to my pettiness and pride. "Screw dinner, I wanted to prove myself right for once in my life!" was the only thing going through my head.</p>

  <p>It did not last long. Not even a couple of minutes and exhaustion started to kick in; my fingers were starting to get sore. Slowly, but surely, I wanted this pointless drivel to stop; it couldn't go on forever. Besides, I was the one who started this fight in the first place.</p>

  <p>It was frustrating. It always does when you have to admit defeat, doesn't it? At least the group chat didn't have two freaks riling up a storm inside it anymore. I had my dinner, relaxed for the rest of the day, and woke up with a clearer mind the next morning. And yet, the damage had already been done. The endless amount of enter-key presses had already been set in stone.</p>
