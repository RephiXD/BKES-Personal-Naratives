  <h1>Numbers and Nightfall</h1>

  <p>Weariness clung to me like an old habit, settling in the moment I stepped into the car.</p>

  <p>When the car stopped in front of the house, I opened the door, walked nonchalantly, entered my room, and immediately plummeted to the bed.</p>

  <p>Closing the door, only a sliver of golden sunlight slipped through the window, lighting that one spot on the bed.</p>

  <p>The deafening silence of the room mirrored the one within. Every thought felt like a problem waiting to be solved, yet none had answers.</p>

  <p>Feeling the gravitational pull of the bed, I did not want to move anymore.</p>

  <p>The only object that piques my vision is the ceiling, and frequently the math exercise book on the table.</p>

  <p><i>Maybe I forgot to put it back yesterday.</i></p>

  <p>I held the calculus book, intending to put it away.</p>

  <p>After lying in bed for too long, I thought going through some math problems would improve my mood, so I opened the book and started to do some math. Numbers were the only thing keeping me sane.</p>

  <p><i>Ugh, why is this so hard? This question on page 9 is so difficult. Why is there a complex number? I thought math was only about real numbers.</i></p>

  <p>Mumbling, and crunching my hair.</p>

  <p>I seem to hate math. The graph function of the derivative was making me crazy.</p>

  <p>The imaginary numbers of the function?! Aren't imaginary numbers not real?</p>

  <p>Fidgeting fingers, red eyes, hatred in my head, everything piled up.</p>

  <p>Frustration.</p>

  <p><i>What did I ever do to deserve this?</i></p>

  <p>My state of mind was not in the book anymore.</p>

  <p>Leaning down to the table. My vision becomes blurry..</p>

  <p>Closing my eyes, I could see her. Smiling, caressing my hair. Comforting me from all of my worries.</p>

  <p>Opening my eyes, I could only feel the tears running down my cheek.</p>

  <p>She's gone.</p>

  <p><i>I wonder if everything I ever did was real, or if it was just a construct, something that only existed in her mind, never grounded in reality.</i></p>

  <p>My consciousness reverted backward, reminiscing when I did things that felt real, buying her gifts, holding hands while watching a movie, and being there for her as a shelter.</p>

  <p>The struggles of the relationship. It all felt real. No complexities of life, just a symplectic life with her.</p>

  <p>She was my pearl, delicate and luminous, and I was the box that kept her safe from all the grimes of the world. She was the one who made me feel like I am loved by someone, a meaning for me to live.</p>

  <p>But apparently, it all fell apart, pieces that I thought were real, turned into imaginative ones.</p>

  <p><i>Now, the box is empty. I'm still here, just as solid, just as strong, but there's nothing left to protect.</i></p>

  <p>Closing the book, I felt uneasy.</p>

  <p><i>I want to turn back time and fix everything.</i></p>

  <p>The palpation of regret, desire to fix everything. It all made complexities that covered my mind with imaginary things I knew I could not do, even with the tears that were being shed on the white tissue.</p>

  <p>At the time I shed the last drop of tears, I opened the book again and continued to the last question I left.</p>

  <p>"An imaginary number is not the same as a real number, but side-by-side we could call it a complex number," the book said.</p>

  <p>I stared at the definition, feeling the weight of it, but something in me shifted.</p>

  <p><i>Maybe she wasn't an illusion after all—just one part of the complexity of my life, something real, even if I couldn't fully understand it.</i></p>
