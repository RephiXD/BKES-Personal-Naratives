  <h1>Through a Frosted Window</h1>

  <p>That Christmas Eve, my 15th one, the house was enveloped in a cozy feeling. Just like every other year, the tree stood tall at the corner of the living room adorned with delicate ornaments and lights we had collected throughout the years. The aroma of cocoa scented candles my mom had bought on a Christmas sale was no doubt a perfect pair to Nat King Cole's Christmas classic, "The Christmas Song" blasting from our speakers.</p>

  <p>Gibberish mumbles what seems like an attempt to sing along with the Christmas songs wandered from the kitchen. Mom was whipping up a home-cooked feast. Various opened bottles of spices scattered along the counter along with leftover peeled potato skin, the chicken was already in the oven and the timer was set.</p>

  <p>"Dek panggilin cece, bentar lagi selesai."</p>

  <p>Amidst the holiday buzz, I lay sprawled across my bed. The distant sound of Christmas music played somewhere in the background, barely reaching my room, as if it belonged to someone else's celebration. My sister's light footsteps seeped through the gap under the wooden door while sounds of canned soda and wine cracked open. Yet, it was just me and my thoughts, lost in the stillness. Had I outgrown Christmas, or had it grown up without me?</p>

  <p>Christmas used to be my favorite time of the year. As a kid, it was pure magic. But what made it truly special was our little tradition. Every year, without fail, we would gather around the TV to watch Home Alone. The sound of Kevin McCallister's mischievous laugh would fill the room as we snuggled under cozy blankets, partnered with the scent of buttery popcorn wafting from our bowls. The house would be warm and dimly lit, with just the flicker of the TV and the lights from the tree illuminating our faces. It was such a simple thing, but as soon as the familiar opening scene started playing, it felt like Christmas had really begun.</p>

  <p>"Malam ini nonton Home Alone yuk."</p>

  <p>Those words slipped out of my mouth just like every other year. It was my 13th Christmas Eve, and everything felt unchanged, just as it always had been. But that night, the TV remained off. We were all preoccupied, and I told myself it didn't matter. We'll watch it tomorrow, I thought. But tomorrow came and went, as did Christmas Day, and before I knew it, the house had quieted down. For the first time, we hadn't watched Home Alone, and something about that small shift felt bigger than I had expected.</p>

  <p>After that, the years slipped by, each one blending into the next as if time itself had smoothed out all the edges. Christmas was never going to be the same. I didn't fully understand it at the time, but something in me knew that a change had happened. That first Christmas without Home Alone felt like a loss. The following years, magic faded into memory, and now Christmas feels more like a nostalgic echo than the vibrant celebration it once was. The songs that once brought me excitement have become bittersweet reminders of what once was. When I hear them, I'm taken back to those days. It's like looking through a frosted window; everything is a little blurred, distant, and unreachable.</p>

  <p>I can't help but long for that old feeling, the kind that made Christmas morning feel like the most thrilling moment in the world. Sometimes, I wish I could go back to those simpler times, when the holidays weren't just another day on the calendar but something to be cherished. But, here I am now, 15, and a little older.</p>

  <p>I got up and opened the door just as my sister's footsteps grew louder in the hallway.</p>

  <p>"Ce ke meja makan, mami hampir selesai."</p>
  
  <p>"Ok."</p>
