        <h1>Cold Solitude</h1>
        <p>Arriving at school, past the gates, into my class, I opened the door and walked to my chair. I dropped my bag and sat down. Closing my eyes, I drifted off, in hopes that this ‘cold’ could disappear. As the bell rang, I awoke with renewed vigor as I became the <i>Happy-go-lucky Pierson</i> again. Hours passed as I diddle dally along the flow, giving out corny jokes time-to-time, and whatnot. But nothing changed. The 'cold' made itself more apparent, especially during lunch. Looking around, to my left were what people would call “Tech” kids. To my right were the ‘sports’ kids. Honestly, nothing wrong with having fun with your kin, it's human nature after all. However, it made me realize something. Something I’ve always pondered.</p>
      
        <p><i>Where do I belong in all this?</i></p>
      
        <p>It was a question that lived rent-free in my mind. Something that has REALLY troubled me ever since Junior High. Back then, I left the ‘home’ I had in my old school, raring to start anew in Sekolah Kristen Calvin. Even if I couldn’t understand their jokes or references, I was confident in my social skills, after all, I was quite popular in my school. So everything should be fine, right?</p>
      
        <p><i>Yeah, I was delusional.</i><p>
      
        <p>Wouldn't you guess it? Turns out, language and culture are indeed a problem—a big one at that. Yes, my grades barely stood afloat, but that was still OK. I could bear that. But what tipped me over the edge was friends. I struggled to make friends, even if I approached them first. There was virtually nobody I could talk to</p>
      
        <p>It was tiring. Felt like I was losing it, day by day. Like a madman, wandering around endlessly in the cold without a place to call home. My only solace from the ‘cold’ was the friends I had kept in touch with, but even then it was far and few between the chaos that reeked my life.</p>
      
        <p>Eventually, I did lose it. I exploded shamefully, and even hurt my friend. It was horrible. It was something I’d prefer not to remember, and indeed I had left it far in the annals of my mind. Up till now, that is. Then it hit me.</p>
      
        <p><i>This familiar 'cold'. I'm back to square one, aren’t I?</i></p>
      
        <p>In all fairness, academic-wise, everything was fine, but that's never been the main issue. I've lost my home again.</p>
      
        <p>There was a time, though—first year of senior high—when school truly felt like ‘home’. It was everything junior high wasn’t. Additionally, I still had my old friends, and life felt, simply put, good. I thought this warmth, this home, would last forever.</p>
      
        <p>But moving into the second year tore me away from the community I called ‘home’. Better yet, now I don’t even have my old friends to keep me sane.</p>
      
        <p><i>I'm tired.</i></p>
      
        <p>I rest my head on the table, staring down at my shoes.</p>
      
        <p><i>Why do I keep trying and trying and trying when I know nobody’s gonna have my back?</i></p>
      
        <p>The cold was chilling. My eyes drifted to my bag. Feeling numb, I thought, <i>'Why not,'</i> as I dug inside my bag and pulled out the Bible. It took some time, but I finally found the verse. I just felt I needed to read. The excerpt described how Jesus Himself, <i>‘hath nowhere to lay His head’</i>.</p>
      
        <p><i>You were homeless just like me, God… Just like me.</i></p>
      
        <p>A grin spread across my face as a wave of warmth flooded my heart. The 'cold' I felt, was no more. I finally found my home, in Him.</p>
      
        <p><i>Thank You, Jesus   :)</i></p>
