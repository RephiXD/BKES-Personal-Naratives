        <h1>A Farewell Unseen</h1>
      
        <p>There was a high-pitched sound coming from my phone. I was suddenly short of breath. The ticking of the clock faded as the air grew thick and hot. My head spun, as though I were trapped on a never-ending roller coaster. The world felt like it had shrunk into that small blue glowing rectangle. Memories flashed through my mind like a breeze of cold air on a chilly December night.</p>
      
        <p>Some time had slipped through the hourglass since I met him. My last memory of him was when we were at a wedding. He was standing in the middle of the crowd, draped in a black suit, a white shirt, and had a new hairstyle since I last met him. He was standing there with his girlfriend, who I had never seen before. Our eyes met, and without a word, our smiles blossomed like old, familiar habits.</p>
      
        <p>"Lama juga ya kita ga ketemu," I said in an ecstatic voice.</p>
      
        <p>"Iya nih, next kita harus naik gunung bareng lagi ya," he said.</p>
      
        <p>"Ayo lahh, gunung terakhir aja sebelom lu udah kerja nanti."</p>
      
        <p>Little did I know that this was my last conversation with him. A few minutes went by and we had to part ways.</p>
      
        <p>If only I knew what would happen, I would talk to him more. There's nothing I can do to change the past. What was holding me back from one more conversation, one more laugh? I remembered the way we struggled up the final slope of that mountain, our legs burning, but our spirits high. He laughed as he reached the peak first, arms wide open, catching the wind like it was his victory.</p>
      
        <p>"Akhirnya sampe juga,", he shouted.</p>
      
        <p>"Lain kali kita naek lagi ya."</p>
      
        <p>But then there was no next time.</p>
      
        <p>As my phone lit up, I couldn't think of anything. A lot of things passed through my mind at once. All I can think about is that one quote. "True friendship knows no end; it transcends time, and no matter the distance, it remains unbroken." They say true friendship knows no end, but that isn't how it feels now. Time and distance have taken their toll. What I thought as a normal and simple farewell was so much deeper than that. He had fallen into a coma. I hadn't known. He was lying there, somewhere, unconscious, and all I had left were memories filled with moments I wish I had cherished more. If only I knew what would happen, I would've talked to him more. But in the end, all I can do is regret, regret, and regret...</p>
      
        <p>I haven't got any news since then. Until one cold night my parents said, "Kita besok malem bakal melayat ya". The air felt thick, heavy, impossible to breathe. It wasn't sadness, not yet. Just disbelief, like my mind couldn't catch up to the words my parents had said.</p>
      
        <p>White silky curtains covered the room like it was a present. The scent of wilting flowers filled the air, mingling with the quiet murmur of voices. As I walked into that room, every step felt like I was dragging the whole world with me. I could still hear his laugh echoing in my head as I stood in the quiet, dim room. Where there had been excitement, plans, and jokes, now there was only silence. It took me a few steps to realize that there he was, again, in the middle of the crowd, draped in a black suit and a white shirt. The difference was I didn't smile when I saw him.</p>
