  <h1>In Step, Out of Place</h1>
  <p>Jakarta, beneath the blanket of smog, suffocating in a haze of pollution. Jakarta, where the sun’s brilliance is dulled by a perpetual grey, and the air clings with thick exhaust and dust. Buses filled with the pungent sour smell of a day’s sweat, sidewalks littered with refuse, the smell of decay rising from every corner while gutters overflow with filth, pooling in narrow alleys.</p>
 
  <p>My mind drifts back to this chaos of Jakarta, to the vibrant cacophony of life that I miss so much. The dystopia I had longed to leave. A month-long summer course in a faraway country felt like the perfect liberation.</p>

  <p>That’s the only thing preoccupying my mind as I sit on a cold bench, staring at the fluorescent lights that seem too bright, too sterile. The station with all its vibrant commercials seemed awfully dull. It’s eerily quiet today—granted, it’s late—with only the distant hum of the late train breaking the silence. I remember how different all this scenery seemed when I first arrived just 2 weeks ago.</p>

  <p>The station enveloped me in all its grandeur. It felt like stepping into a grand labyrinth, each turn revealing a new layer of complexity. Colourful commercials plaster the walls, casting a spectrum on polished floors. Rhythmic announcements and train jingles echo in the hallways, guiding yet overwhelming. Hordes of people rushing in a synchronised orderly chaos. All a testament to the rules of the land, it was amazing, it was exciting.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't long before the allure of perfection gave way to an uncomfortable realization: I wasn’t part of the flow—I was standing outside it, trying to catch up.</p>

  <p>That tension boiled over the very next day, I missed the train by just a second. A simple hesitation at the platform was all it took. The people around me didn’t scold me; they didn’t have to. Their quick, indifferent glances told me I wasn’t part of the seamless flow, I was a wrinkle in its fabric.</p>

  <p>As the days turned into weeks, my initial excitement began to wane, giving way to a latent sense of unease, the colourful utopia I dreamt of quickly turned monochrome.</p>

  <p>It was suffocating. The very thing that had fascinated me—the order, the precision—became a trap. Every day felt like a performance, copying the other’s steps to fit in: standing in perfect lines at the station, keeping my head down, never bumping into anyone, always on time. The more I tried to conform, the more out of place I was.</p>

  <p>My reflection in the train's glass windows seemed foreign to me, a face lost in the crowd. No smiles, no eye contact. Their gazes were trained forward, indifferent, but I could feel the weight of silent judgment each time I hesitated for a second too long. I was an outsider looking in, never quite able to break through the invisible barrier that separated me from everyone else.</p>

  <p>In Jakarta, chaos meant freedom—here, order felt like constraint. I had thought control would be liberating, but in this world, it suffocated me more than the thickest smog ever could.</p>

  <p>Two more weeks. I’ll be back—back to Jakarta’s smog-filled skies and streets that never sleep. Where the sun fights to shine through the haze, but the city pulses with life anyway. I used to see only the grime, the noise, the chaos. Now I see the resilience beneath it all—the way the sidewalks teem with energy, the way the city breathes, even when it chokes</p>

  <br><p>Hey Jakarta, I’m back.</p>
  <br><p>Not for better or for worse, just for what it is.</p>
