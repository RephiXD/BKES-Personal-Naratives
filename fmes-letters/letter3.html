  <h1>The Last Game</h1>
  <p>“GOBLOK LU, TOLOL, BISA MAIN GAK SIH ANJING?!” The words came out from my mouth, evil and sharp like a blade cutting through the silence of that December night. “LU TUH BEBAN BANGSAT, MATI AJA, GAUSA MAIN!” I don’t know how I could let those words step out so easily, so harshly, from my ruthless throat. Even now, those words become an echo in my mind, like shadows that refuse to be laid to rest and haunt me every time I remember you.</p>

  <p>Wasn’t that a fun time, buddy? That time when the spirit for playing Mobile Legends seemed endless with every shout of "GAS!". When we would laugh until our insides hurt, the sounds of our joy filled the darkness of our WhatsApp calls. The midnight moon seemed like an old friend, nodding knowingly each time we said, "GAS, LAST GAME," only to queue up again and again. Wasn’t that fun?</p>

  <p>But I was the one who turned it all sour. I was the storm that darkened our skies. On that crucial December night, as defeat after defeat piled up on us, I lost control. I let my frustration, my anger, my pride dominate me on the seventh loss.</p>

  <p>"GOBLOK LU BISA MAIN GAK SIH, NYUSAHIN GW DOANG!” I shouted, my voice cutting through the air like a sword. You paused, your voice trembling slightly as you asked softly. “Sorry Bry, last game?”, your words were filled with guilt.</p>

  <p>I knew deep down that you never meant to be a burden. I knew that you were trying your best. But I was blinded by my own emotions, deafened by the roar of my own ego. And so, I kept blaming, kept throwing bad words at you like stones.</p>

  <p>“Yaudah, ayo tapi lu jangan beban lagi ya bego,” I replied, my tone sounded cold and uncaring. I was drowned in my own anger to notice the guilt in your voice.</p>

  <p>The stars and the moon became silent witnesses to my cruelty that night. They watched as I let the devil get into my heart, as I tore you down when I should have lifted you up. I called you a burden, the worst teammate I’d ever had, not realizing that those words, those terrible words, would be the last ones I would ever say to you.</p>

  <p>If only I could go back… If only I could turn back time and take back every hateful thing I said. But time doesn’t work like that, it is always moving forward, never allowing me to return to the moments I regret the most. And so, I’m left here, haunted by the memory of that December night, wishing I could tell you just one more time how much our friendship meant to me.</p>

  <p>Countless games we’ve played, endless nights filled with laughter. We bared our souls to each other, sharing dreams, fears, and the deepest corners of our hearts, revealing the parts of ourselves no one else could see, trusting that our vulnerabilities would be safe in each other's hands. Now, only emptiness remains, the haunting realization that something so beautiful was destroyed... by me.</p>

  <p>If only I could have been kinder, softer, more understanding. If only I could tell you how much I regret every heartless word. But wishes are just whispers to the wind, and now, all I have left is the shadow of that December night, surrounding my heart, a reminder of how precious the thing I lost was. I'm sorry, buddy. I wish I realized that last game was truly the last game we had ever played together.</p>
