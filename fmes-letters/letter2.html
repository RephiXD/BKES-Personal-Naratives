      <h1>Even When Your Fingers Slipped Away</h1>
      <p>Even though the chapel sounds alive with the sound of singing and instruments, all I could focus on were the whispers and chuckles around me. Their whispers cut through the music, directly to my ears. The pianist, wore a mix of frustration and worry on their face — a simple mistake, wrong finger placement which led to the wrong note.</p>
    
      <p>They might find it “a lil funny”. But I don't. I suddenly became silent, contemplating. I know how it feels to misplace a finger, something that seems normal to most people, to make you feel that the air around you becomes heavy, filled with judgment, sometimes even when people actually don't really care about your mistake.</p>
    
      <p>I know, I’d been there before.</p>
    
      <p>Suddenly, I was back on another stage, another crowd. A competition. A different beast. Confidence had always been my shield, or maybe it was arrogance. Either way, I will win it.</p>
    
      <p>It might sound impossible, but I used to collect piano awards like Pokemon.</p>
    
      <p>I had won every competition at every level that a junior high schooler could reach, even pocketed the award that I am most proud of, a Diamond Award: the highest award at the Indonesian National Piano Festival. Invitations to compete rained down on me, both from my school and my coaches.</p>
    
      <p>"Kamu mau jadi perwakilan sekolah Tog?" said my teacher.</p>
    
      <p>"Dek mau ikut yang di Jakarta gak? Miss punya teman disana bilang kontestan nya cakep-cakep lhoo," said my coach.</p>
    
      <p>No matter how bad I think my performance is, I snatched a bronze at least. My parents and coach used  to warn me to practice harder, but I waved them off. Why practice when winning felt like a given?</p>
    
      <p>One day I was chosen to represent my school to compete in a piano competition in Ancol. As usual, I hadn’t practiced much. And as usual, I expected to win.</p>
      
      <p>On the day of the competition, I went there with my coach of course, but this time, my girlfriend too. This is her first time watching me compete live, which was one of the main motivations for the day.</p>
    
      <p>My name was called. I stepped onto the stage, lights warm and familiar, sat at the grand piano, and began to play. The notes flowed effortlessly, my fingers gliding over the keys. It felt right. It always did.</p>
    
      <p>Until it didn’t</p>
    
      <p>My fingers collided, the sound contrasting, wrong. Totally wrong.</p>
    
      <p>I stared at the keys, my fingers frozen. My heart pounded louder than the melody. I forced my hands to play, but the notes came out wrong, mixed up, because I heard the murmurs and whispers of the judges and audience.</p>
    
      <p>Finished, I stumbled off the stage, my legs weak. Coach tried to cheer me up, but her words were muffled, drowned by the failure ringing in my ears. I felt hollow, something inside me had broken.</p>
    
      <p>For years, I avoided the piano, haunted by that disaster, too scared to play in front of anyone that I know well — friends and teachers.</p>
    
      <p>It’s only through church that I find my way back, little by little. There were no judges, no expectations. Even though I make  a mistake, it's not a big deal, I guess. Slowly, I began to play to serve, rather than something tied to awards and titles.</p>
    
      <p>Back in the chapel, the laughter of my friends faded into the background. I still  didn’t laugh. How could I? I knew the feeling all too well — heart pounding, hands shaking, I knew the courage it took to keep playing, even when your fingers slipped away.</p>
