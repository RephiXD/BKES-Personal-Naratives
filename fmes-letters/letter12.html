        <h1>Popo's Special Bacang</h1>
        <p>The smell of meat came from the kitchen, blended with the distinctive aroma of dried shrimp, peanuts, and shiitake. Thysanolaena leaves, or its familiar name, "daun bacang," fell scattered almost in every corner of the room.</p>
      
        <p>"Eh, udah bikin bacang lagi aja ya," I said to my mom.</p>
      
        <p>Mom seemed very focused on the bacang in her hand. Sticky rice was placed layer by layer with some meat and other topping in the middle. Then, the rope began to tangle around the dumplings and a bacang was done.</p>
      
        <p>Every year on this day, mom would wrap some 'special' bacang, sticky rice dumplings with unsticky plain rice. Why? I wondered about this too.</p>
      
        <p>"Buat popo ini, Ke. Biasa popo gamau makan yang ketan."</p>
      
        <p>Then, I would protest by rolling my eyes, but mom would still make this kind of weird bacang. Huh, a taste that I never understood as a kid.</p>
      
        <p>Grandma is a person that I didn't really know. Even though we were connected by the same blood, a relationship that should be very close, we seemed more like strangers to each other. When I was a small kid, she didn't talk too much to everyone, including me. I didn't even remember she ever called my name.</p>
      
        <p>Yet, when I was in primary school, she got sick and started to change. She became more annoying, complained about everything, and also, was picky about food. It was probably the reason why mom started to make this 'special' bacang.</p>
      
        <p>...</p>
      
        <p>Come to think of it, I unconsciously said, "Mami ga bikin yang nasi? Kan biasa popo..."the second half of the sentence was swallowed, as if my throat was strangled by an invisible hand.</p>
      
        <p>I always remember that 4 months ago, it was almost 11 PM, and it was like any other night except mom still hadn't come back home as usual. Suddenly, dad's phone started ringing. When I thought mom would tell us why she hadn't returned home or asked dad to pick her up, an unbelievable message came out from her lips.</p>
      
        <p>She told us that her mom, my grandma, had left us.</p>
      
        <p>Through the phone, faint cries were heard behind mom and she sounded like she just cried. Dad held the phone, he didn't say anything, he probably also knew whatever he said would seem faded at that moment. Quietness filled the room as emptiness did to my heart.</p>
      
        <p>The next day, notifications started popping up on my phone. Everyone's condolences that were sent to me reminded me of the reality that grandma had already passed away.</p>
      
        <p>At first, I guessed that the only thing that remained between us was just the thin link of blood. Except that, there was nothing left. But, it seemed to be more than that.</p>
      
        <p>I suddenly realized that I would never see her again, would never hear her complaints again, and would never have a chance to call her "popo" again. She was gone from my life, without any goodbye. Now, I really lost her.</p>
      
        <p>...</p>
      
        <p>The silence took over, and the only sound left was the boiling water in the steamer. It was time to put the bacang in. "Tadi ngomong apa, Ke? Mami ga denger," it was as she sensed that moment of silence.</p>
      
        <p>"Ngga, gapapa", I whispered slowly. "Tadi kepikiran biasa popo maunya makan yang nasi."</p>
      
        <p>"Popo udah gausah dibikinin lagi, popo udah di surga," I heard a touch of relief.</p>
      
        <p>Perhaps grief still left a mark. But, we know that grandma doesn't need that special bacang again, because she has already gone to a more special place.</p>
