  <h1>Quest for Redemption</h1>
  <p>Heart beat, nervousness, expectation, and adrenaline that’s what I could feel at that moment.</p>

  <p>I had thought about this moment since last night. I kept wondering, could I perform well? Could I do better than yesterday? And the most important thing could I help my team to win the match?</p>

  <p>I knew that my high school futsal team hasn't won any trophies since 2011. I wasn’t even in elementary school yet that year. From the first time I entered this futsal team, my main goal was to win trophies and break the terrible record.</p>

  <p>The moment had come, finally the heated match began.</p>

  <p>Both teams started the match with fiery passion and an ambition that must be pursued, back and forth attacks were shown as the crowd kept cheering. Suddenly a thunderball made it through our defense, and at the right place a forceful hand blocked the ball. It’s not a keeper’s hand and you know that it’s a bad sign for us. Arguments and lies surrounded the referee, but the decision has been made “a penalty is given!” said the commentator.</p>

  <p>Our keeper was focused, the crowd was silent, and our opponent pulled the shot trigger. Our keeper dived his body with full stretch following the shot, but the goddess of fortune was not yet on our side.The shot was so strong that it ripped our net. The score changed 1-0.</p>

  <p>The pressure was on our side now, we were down 1-0 and there’s not much time left. Ambition and expectation flinched in my eyes that made our team press brutally and gave all that we had.</p>

  <p>My teammate tried to penetrate their defense with his speed and agility but a hand grabbed his shirt and dragged him down to the floor. Finally our hard work paid off, the referee gave us a penalty. The crowd was silent again. My beads of sweat fell down the white dots as I put the ball with the valve in the middle heading towards me just like what Roberto Carlos did to his outstanding goals back in his prime.</p>

  <p> “It’s the last kick of the game, with all hope of his supporter, and his teammate on his shoulder, can he do it?” said the commentator. I took a deep breath and tried to focus, finally I took my step and pulled the trigger. And yet again it’s not my lucky day, i hit the crossbar and the match ended. We lost. </p>

  <p>I was frustrated and upset, but my teammates came and gave me support. They said “it hasn’t ended, we rely on you tomorrow”. I just realized that we still have a match for third place tomorrow.</p>

  <p>At this moment I remember when we had a teamtalk with our coach before this tournament started. “Tomorrow we have a tournament to cap what we have done all this time. Remember the first day that we met, remember all the training that we have, all the time we left the field exhausted. Tomorrow we get ours! Reward ourselves with victory and at the end of the tournament we leave as a champion and say that we have given everything for this shirt.” said our coach.</p>

  <p>The day arrived, the battle for third place was about to begin. The crowd made a tremendous atmosphere in the building, their voices were thunderous as flags waved all along the side of the court. Players were warming up with intense focus as the countdown to the match started. The referee blew his whistle, and finally the match began
