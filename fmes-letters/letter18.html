  <h1>Not The Last “Goodbye”</h1>
  <p>Sitting in the back seat and seeing the darkness of the road felt very different. My phone in hand with Whatsapp group chat opened with unfinished sentences. Honestly, I didn't want to go on as I thought it would be my last words to them.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>That morning, looking at the 22 other students, memories began to flood back. Nervous and unsure on our first day of 10th grade. But it wasn't long before I met three new friends. Our first lunch, filled with awkwardness, marked the beginning of a special friendship. Christy's blunt humor always managed to lighten the mood while Fellinskie was the thoughtful one. We shared deep conversations that revealed her genuine concern for others. Michelle had an incredible sense of humor. Her jokes and stories made her the glue that held us all close. At school events, we spent hours together at the games, cheering each other on and laughing. That day was filled with joy. Our first moments - first day of class, first photo on our homeroom teacher's birthday, and the little surprise we planned for him, are unforgettable.</p>

  <p>But all those "firsts" eventually became "lasts"—the last time we met, the last time we started class together, and the last time we took pictures together.</p>

  <p>As I thought back to that morning, my eyesight began to blur to see the darkness of the road.</p>

  <p>That day, as the bell rang again, my homeroom teacher came, with a sigh, she said, "Jadi, hari ini hari terakhir Trifosa di sini, setelah selesai kalian bisa mengucapkan perpisahan." All eyes turned to me, and I managed a faint smile. The class leader prepared the class and that was the last time I greeted my teacher.</p>

  <p>I walked into the cafeteria, my backpack felt heavier than ever. My gaze landed on my closest friends who greeted me with a smile. We shared a quiet moment but I wished it could last forever. My phone buzzed—two missed calls from my mom and a message reminding me I had to leave.</p>

  <p>"Guys, aku harus pulang sekarang..." The words heavy in my chest.</p>

  <p>"Is this really the last time?" I wondered.</p>

  <p>They were all staring at me, no words out, warmth filled me as their arms wrapped around me.</p>

  <p>"See you again," Fellin whispered through a hug. A silent promise of future reunions that felt reassuring. Another friend followed, her arms wrapped around me. "Until next time," she echoed softly, her words a tender reminder of the countless moments we had shared.</p>

  <p>"Good luck in Jakarta," they said in turn, their tone warm and encouraging as always. I nodded, but inside, I wasn't ready to say goodbye. The same words we use every day to say goodbye after school - but this time was different, they marked a farewell with no certainty. When would we meet again?</p>

  <p>"Please, let's keep in touch." I whispered.</p>

  <p>With a deep breath, I walked away, I realized I wasn't really leaving them behind. I carried them with me, every laugh, every moment of support and encouragement.</p>

  <p>Tears ran down my cheeks silently. As I sat in the car, the weight of the goodbye still hung over me. I finally finished typing the message I'd started earlier:</p>

  <p>"Thank you for accompanying me in this high school. Because of you guys, even though I've only been here for a year, my high school years are so exciting and memorable. Thank you for making my time in Surabaya more beautiful.."</p>

  <p>"Till we meet again."</p>

  <p>It wasn't the last goodbye. I believed we'd meet again someday.</p>
