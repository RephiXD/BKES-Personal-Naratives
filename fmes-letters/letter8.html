        <h1>The Weight of Acceptance</h1>
        <p>Mom and Dad never expected much from me. They liked simple lives and simple goals. I broke away from that mindset, striving to be more ambitious. To do that, I needed to improve. I needed to be the best. So, I wrote down typical goals like any other ambitious high school student.</p>
      
        <p>Goal: Scholarships and Accreditation for University.</p>
      
        <p>Failure: Unacceptable</p>
      
        <p>These were what I hoped to achieve. Mom and Dad always taught that everything else would follow with hard work. It was the things not seen that were important. After all those hours, it was only a matter of time. My mind cleared from the distant memory. Stepping out of my bedroom, the light orange beam began to dim, and my eyes adjusted. I rub my temples, feeling the little pocket valley beneath my eyes. </p>
      
        <p><i>I should take care of that. Later.</i></p>
      
        <p>Back on my desk, I open my laptop. Feeling the glossy, dilapidated keys again, I enter my password and write my sorrows away, hoping my fiery, aching heart will settle. My thoughts dwell on that morning in school. At the time, the sun shone brightly on us all. I enjoyed all the discussions and the grueling busy day ending. I breezed through the day with flying colors.</p>
      
        <p>Once sunset came, something changed. A joyous feeling should have emerged, but I felt the opposite. When one simple email brought the news of my goal, which I had poured all my efforts into, that slipped away. Judgment came: “Why didn’t you get it?”</p>
      
        <p>Afterward, I started to lose my grip. Colors meshed rigorously, shapes lost their edge, and lights shone from the dark. I initially thought my mind was losing composure, but I was drenched for a minute…or two hours.</p>
      
        <p>My thoughts flashed back once my friend began to talk about that wretched email. This is my breaking point. Many lines read: “Even he got it,” and, “I thought you were smart.”</p>
      
        <p><i>How could you say that?</i><p>
      
        <p><i>What on earth are all my efforts for? Am I not enough? Have I…failed?</i></p>
      
        <p>Pushing myself from the desk, I snapped. My room became a mess. Sheets of paper got stuck on the ceiling, books flew off the shelves, crumpling themselves up, and the mug shattered on ceramic floors. My tantrums led to loud screeching and violent twitching. Louder and louder. </p>
      
        <p>Guilt, anger, and dread refuse to leave. They shouted in my ears. I can’t make them shut up. Ding, ding, reminding me of my failure over and over and over.</p>
      
        <p><i>The hours you’ve spent, the preparation you’ve planned, the sacrifices you’ve committed, the goals you’ve set—disappearing in the dark. All because you couldn’t get that goal. You failed to be the best. Now, you’re worthless.</i></p>
      
        <p>Beyond the loud shouts of emotions, a voice knocks on my door. “Son, are you alright?”</p>
      
        <p>Dad’s presence is a silent, calming breeze. He reaches out to me.</p>
      
        <p>He didn’t say “I told you so,” and didn’t intend to calm me down.</p>
      
        <p>He set me amongst the voices in a different way</p>
      
        <p>His point was clear, though hard to accept; it puts my commitment into perspective.</p>
      
        <p>“Get up and do the best you can. That’s what’s important. Keep doing what is good and right, and an Angel of God will look down and say ‘Here lies a good person.’”</p>
      
        <p>I did end up silencing the voices, both inside and out, but my mind was still fixated on that failure. Still, I will fall. Still, I will crumble. At the very least, I know I matter much more than mere credit. </p>
      
        <p>For tonight, my troubles end here. </p>
