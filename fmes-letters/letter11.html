  <h1>Death in Broad Daylight</h1>
  <p>It was an ordinary day just like any other day. Life goes on as usual, school passed by as a slight breeze in a strong wind. I never had thought of life as something to cherish, especially when everything just repeats in a loop. Wake up, go to school, go home, sleep. I never remembered anything important from my life in elementary school. The thought of not having anything to share about my days in elementary was daunting, hence my choice of trying something new.</p>

  <p>As junior high started, I got interested in trying a new sport, specifically basketball. I was never into basketball until this time, though I should admit that I was very out of shape. The training we had there was harder than I'd ever imagined. I sweated profusely as my thighs slowly turned into overcooked spaghetti. Well, that wasn't the main problem.</p>

  <p>I crashed into the car seat as I imagined having a cozy nap, but only to find myself wide awake, not because of the extra energy, but of something bothering me.</p>

  <p>"What's this weight on my chest?"</p>
  
  <p>"Is it my bag?"</p>
  
  <p>"Didn't I put my bag in the back?"</p>

  <p>Thoughts rushed through my head as my breathing got heavier and heavier as if something heavy was on my chest. I tried harder and harder as I gasped for air so loud that my mom overheard me having a hard time breathing. She knew what was wrong the instant she heard, and immediately decided that I should go to the hospital.</p>

  <p>Arriving there, it was not as smooth sailing as expected. The hospital was crowded and noisy, so we waited. Waiting wasn't fun either, dealing with the pain as I tried to breathe normally.</p>

  <p>After hours of waiting, I was finally called in. It was a simple check-up after my mom told the nurse about my symptoms. The nurse handed me a colorful pinwheel and asked me to blow into it. As I blew <i>fuuuuuhhh……</i>, the pinwheel spun in a slow, depressing spin. She immediately knew that it was asthma, a sickness that could be very dangerous if not handled properly. So I was admitted to the ICU as the nurse fetched some medication. It was so awful that they had me stay in a room and held me hospital bound.</p>

  <p>Being hospital bound for the first time was a shocking experience. It was such a bizarre experience not going to school for a day. Surprisingly, it felt good, not feeling the stress of going to school, not waking up early for once. It was like a pause button in the busy and stressful world I was living in. It was a breather for once that had me think about life all over again.</p>

  <p>The stay wasn't that bad, since the treatment quickly sealed away the asthma. The thing that stood out the most wasn't how I overcame my asthma. Instead, it was how I thought of life during those critical moments, reminiscing the memories I had with my family, both good and bad.</p>

  <p>I went home the next day, with a new feeling of hope in life. I received an inhaler to help relieve me from asthma if it strikes again. I eagerly rushed home, seeing how relieved my brother and sister were that I was back safely. It might seem as if nothing had changed in my life, but deep down I had realized that even if my life wasn't significant for myself, there are always other people that care for me, especially God who will always be by my side.</p>
