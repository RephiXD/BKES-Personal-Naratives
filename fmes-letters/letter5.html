        <h1>Driving Away</h1>
        <p>Thousands of car crashes happen each year, each one leaving scars or even claiming lives, yet somehow, my trembling hands are gripping the wheel of this monstrous vehicle.</p>
      
        <p>“Pa, I’m not so sure about this,” I said nervously.</p>
      
        <p>“You’ll be fine, I trust in you. You’ve finished your lessons.”</p>
      
        <p>Sure, I’d completed a 10-hour driving course, but this time was different. There were no extra brakes on the passenger side and no instructor to save me from a wrong move. The ginormous ‘LATIHAN’ sign informing people I was still a novice too was gone. I felt like an imposter on the road, pretending to know what I was doing.</p>
      
        <p>Dad made sure to bring me to the emptiest of roads. He whispered his directions in a calm yet firm tone, scared that loud voices would shatter my focus.</p>
      
        <p>“Slow down when meeting a junction. Watch out for other vehicles.”</p>
      
        <p>He was my second pair of eyes on the road. Always alert. Always watching.</p>
      
        <p>Being allowed to learn to drive was strange, really. If Dad is able to drive me to the ends of the earth, he would have done so without question. He always insists on driving me anywhere. He made sure that no harm came my way.</p>
      
        <p>As the sound of tires hummed against the road, my heart beat steadily, matching the rhythm of the car’s movements. I was filled with the joy of control. Soon, I wouldn’t need to rely on anyone to take me anywhere. I wouldn’t even need to rely on my dad.</p>
      
        <p>When I asked to go to bigger and busier roads, I caught a familiar look in his eyes, the look filled with pride yet sadness at the same time as he came to terms that his daughter is growing up. It was the same one he had when I first mentioned leaving for college. The worst part about having a child is knowing that you’re teaching them to be independent, even when it means to be independent from you. Somewhere along the lines though, Dad realized that he will have to step back and watch me take control. I guess this is what love does – it lets go, even when every instinct in your body tells you to hold on tighter. </p>
      
        <p>As I pulled over, Dad’s voice broke the silence of the moment.</p>
      
        <p>“Switch places with me, De,” he said.</p>
      
        <p>As I got out and slid into the passenger’s seat, I felt a surge of comfort knowing that he is still here right there beside me. </p>
      
        <p>As much as I’ve been craving the freedom of driving – the freedom of leaving – there’s a sudden ache knowing what this newfound freedom meant for the both of us. With college around the corner, we won’t be under the same roof anymore.</p>
      
        <br><p>No more cheesy jokes.</p>
      
        <br><p>No more off-key karaoke singing.</p>
      
        <br><p>No more reassuring smile, guiding me through the tricky turns I have to take.</p>
      
        <br><p>None of us are ready for this to happen; perhaps we’ll never truly be ready. But it’s inevitable. Soon enough, I’ll drive away, as his figure on the rearview mirror becomes smaller, and smaller. I'll make sure to steer this wheel toward success, carrying his lessons with me wherever I go. I’ll always remember to visit and tell him about every road I’ve seen. And though I’m setting out on my own, a part of me will always be his little girl gripping the wheel, feeling safe under the watchful eyes of the one who taught me how to steer.</p>
