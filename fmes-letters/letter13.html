  <h1>Snacks, Sweats, and So Hee</h1>
  
  <p>"STOP IT!" shouts the angel on my right shoulder.</p>
  <p>"Why should you care about it? Just be HAPPY," says the devil on the other side.</p>

  <p>I hate that angel so much. I never thought in my life that I would listen to him. Yet, without him, I don't know what's gonna happen to me. Maybe I will become a teenager that can't even dribble a basketball or become someone who has to buy 2 plane tickets for my flights.</p>

  <p>When the pandemic hits, my weight is almost 100 kg, and since then, Netflix has been my partner in crime. Watching Han So Hee's romantic series on a rainy Saturday? Absolutely my kind of therapy! How could you not fall in love with a beautiful girl with such a calming face, working out right in front of you ? (okay, through the screen)</p>

  <p>While she's busy burning calories, I'm caught in a slightly different kind of workout. Four sets of reaching snacks for every new episode. That's the only workout that I do. Munching and munching.</p>
  
  <p>I didn't see it coming when my body demands some real workout. As usual, I wait for all my teachers to finish their speech while I watch So Hee on my phone. Except when PE Class rolls around. Our PE teacher always seems to come up with the most ridiculous assignments. I'd rather actually pick Kanye to be the next president than see him as my PE teacher.</p>
  
  <p>"Seperti biasa lihat tugas classroom. You can do that now or later ya!" he says with his Indonesian accent and unserious voice.</p>
  
  <p>Thank God the task is clear and short. I only need to run 500 meters as fast as I can. Without second thought about my hippopotamus body, I confidently tell my big brother to record my run. I began to move my leg as fast as possible. As the wind goes by, my long hair starts to fly for.... 4 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>Yeah, I can run for only 4 seconds before my legs suddenly tremble to the ground. I gasp, gasp, gasp, and gasp. I cannot stand up. My nose starts to bleed. Meanwhile my brother starts to scream like Tarzan in the jungle. He freaks out. Well, ME TOO. Mostly because my dream to be So Hee's husband in her future K-Drama is shattered.</p>
  
  <p>At that moment I realized that I can't eat KFC anymore.</p>
  
  <p>I don't want to lay down the black smelly mattress and start to sit-up.</p>
  
  <p>I don't want to watch "How to do the perfect push-up" video on Ade Rai's channel.</p>
  
  <p>I don't want to squat and wake up with sore legs.</p>
  
  <p>I don't want to throw up eating chicken broccoli and rice.</p>

  <p>But only to be So Hee's husband, I do it.</p>
  
  <p>I lay down that black smelly mattress and start to do sit-ups.</p>
  
  <p>I start to watch 10 Ade Rai's videos and start to do the perfect push-up.</p>
  
  <p>I bring up my 3kg barbel and start to squat it down.</p>
  
  <p>I eat my broccoli with dry, humid chicken and rice.</p>
  
  <p>With all drops of sweat, in the end, I know it is all worth it. Each time I feel like giving up, I remember that moment: gasping on the floor, my nose bleeding, and also the Tarzan scream. It is a wake-up call that my body needs more than just Netflix and snacks. Maybe, just maybe, if I stick it out, I won't just survive another PE class. I'll be one step closer to being Han So Hee's future husband. Anything is possible, right?</p>
