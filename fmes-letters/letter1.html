  <h1>Unreal</h1>
  <p>A hallway, blindingly white, impossibly tall. Heavy panting could be heard. It was me, I stumbled up a flight of stairs, being chased by something, a humanoid figure. He has no face, but I knew him. As I was about to reach the top, I tripped, I ended up on the ground, staring at my own shadow. Even that disappeared, I was somehow on my back, staring at the figure on top of me. He thrust a large needle into my abdomen, again, and again, and again. I looked at his face, it was me. We plastered smiles on our faces as my vision fades to black</p>
  <p>My eyes shoot open, a deafening tone ringing in my ears, a wave of pain piercing my abdomen. I gasp for air, but something is pressing against my chest. I try to move, but I can’t even move a finger. The pain in my abdomen slowly subsides, quickly replaced with a familiar feeling of helplessness.</p>
  <p>Sleep paralysis. <i>Again?</i> 
Sleep paralysis. Again? I thought to myself, at this point it was almost chronic. I’d gotten so used to them that it didn’t even surprise me anymore</p>
  <p> I know this isn’t real, it only <i>looks</i> like my room, and at first glance, it is. However, I direct my vision (not eyes) upward, and I see a dull ceiling staring back at me. I sleep on a lower bunk, my father sleeps on top, I shouldn’t be able to see the ceiling. In fact, I couldn’t even see the bedframe or hear my father’s loud snoring. In this world, only I exist.</p>
 
  <p><i>Am I really that stressed?</i> I think, trying to escape from this fake reality. My vision moves around the room, at this point, I don’t think I can call it mine anymore. Many things - notably those I don’t recognize as my belongings - aren’t present. My sister’s painting isn’t hung on the wall, my brother’s stuffed toys are gone.</p>
 
  <p>They say that the dreamworld is a product of our subconscious, it’s how we perceive the real reality. What does this reality of mine force me to confront? Try to ignore it, try to deny it, try not to name it, this feeling. My description turned into emotion - being alone, into loneliness.</p>
 
  <p>Why do I choose to be alone? I don’t know who to trust, I don’t trust. Not my classmates, not my family, not me. Connecting with people is terrifying, I don’t know what they’re thinking, they throw insults at each other and laugh them off. I just can’t understand, looking at it makes me feel like I’m not a real person. What I feel doesn’t matter. Try hard enough, I might come off almost similar to anyone else.</p>

  <p>I feel disoriented, I am waking up. My surroundings go dark, revealing that my eyes have been closed the whole time, reaffirming that I was seeing nothing more than an imitation.</p>
 
  <p>Back in the real world, eyes wide open, I get out of my bed. I take a look at the time, it’s the same as always. I walk out of my room to get a drink, giving a vague greeting to my parents before getting ready for school; same as always. Everything’s going on like normal. It’s almost like last night didn’t happen. Like everything I’ve been struggling with was never real to begin with.</p>
