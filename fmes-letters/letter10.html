  <h1>Decrepit Young Man</h1>
  
  <p>I recline in a cold machine, facing an iron ceiling with a blanket covering and protecting me from the bitter. The sound of music pounds in my ears through the headset the nurse gave me. It precludes the sound of a machine that sounds like an ambulance. Fifteen minutes in it feels like an everlasting hour of staying in Antarctica. Boring, lonely, painful, and cold.</p>

  <p>I had been sitting in my room talking with my mother and my grandmother a day before. We discussed my future education journey and my destination university. After we ended our chit-chat, something wrong happened with my back. At first, it was not that painful and I tried to sleep like usual and assumed that the next morning I would be alright again. But my assumption was wrong. It was as if I was carrying the weight of the world. My feet couldn't even move and my scream boomed throughout the room followed by my grandmother's footsteps which were moving rapidly like a sports car. She left her yellow spiced fried chicken in a frying pan and hurriedly called my mother.</p>

  <p>"Anak lu sakit ni, bawa ke dokter cepet, daritadi udah teriak-teriak kesakitan."</p>

  <p>An hour later my mom took me to the hospital with her black favorite car. The car moved quickly like being chased by many cheetahs until we arrived and underwent the procedure in the hospital. A doctor said to me that I needed to follow an MRI procedure. That's why I end up staying in this machine right now.</p>

  <p>As the music stops, the machine's sound suddenly stops too. A couple of enormous hands help me to get out of the machine. The cold air almost makes me freeze. Maybe this is the first and last time I want to take an MRI test. If I had known about the MRI procedure before, I wouldn't have wanted to do it. After that, I need to go and wait in my first-class hospital room since my mom has already finished the hospital administration.</p>

  <p>The scent of an antiseptic envelops the room and welcomes me benignly. A low-volume TV in the middle of the room covers the serenity. A squeaky wheelchair brings me to the front of my bed and a pair of warm hands helps me to lie down. As I had already laid down on my bed, the patter of big feet slapped across the hospital floor in front of my room. The door is suddenly open. A doctor with a bleak face enters my room. His hands are filled with patient reports and one of those is mine. He starts to explain my situation.</p>

  <p>Every word that comes from his mouth makes my heart beat faster and faster. Perhaps that is the good news.</p>

  <p>As the doctor leaves the room, tears stream down my face. My throat closes up. I try to fight back tears but I can't. Anxious, apprehensive, and fear fill my mind in one moment. It feels like my bright future is dispersed in a moment. Since I was in 4th grade, sports have been part of my life. The fact that I can't play any sports again except swimming makes me down so bad.</p>

  <p>It means that seven years of my journey were gone because of this? I can't even accept it. My mom tries to soothe me, she takes a lot of tissue in her gentle hand and gives it to me. I need at least an hour to truly stop crying. I don't even know what I need to do next.</p>
