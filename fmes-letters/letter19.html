        <h1>The Failure of a Lifetime</h1>
        
        <p>Sunlight streamed through the gaps of my curtain, as my alarm blared relentlessly, desperately pulling me away from my sleep. I then lifted my half-awake body from the warm, cozy embrace of my bed, reaching for my phone to see my schedule for today.</p>
      
        <p>"Let's see… ooh we have PE today, that should be fun."</p>
      
        <p>I peeked at the other subjects, convincing myself that today might be a good day, until I slightly glanced down, shifting my focus to something else.</p>
      
        <p>"Yikes, there's that one English subject at the end of the day."</p>
        <p>All hope suddenly vanished as if the sky had collapsed on me.</p>
      
        <p>English class is indeed unique, much like art class where I get to be creative as long as I produce results. But in reality, the assignments from past years had traumatized me for life.</p>
      
        <p>The first year of senior high school, we had to prepare a TedTalk about, well… anything interesting really. Unfortunately back then I was the quietest and loneliest guy in my class, lacking motivation whatsoever to do homework, moreover sharing knowledge and experience with people I barely knew. Heck, I don't even have any of those so-called experiences because those 2 years in the pandemic I kept indulging myself playing roblox till late in the morning. So of course my presentation went terribly wrong, making me regret not preparing better back then.</p>
      
        <p>The next year came IdeaFest, another presentation type assignment but in groups. And yet I failed again. I couldn't finish editing the video on time which forced us to present a slide that wasn't even done. Again I couldn't prove there is more that I could do.</p>
      
        <p>I couldn't help but wonder, since the last 2 projects had been mentally exhausting, wouldn't grade 12 have the hardest project yet, one that I can't even bear to imagine? Unexpectedly, it's totally different this year…</p>
      
        <p>Personal Narrative</p>
        <p>This is perfect! The one thing I can do (or can't possibly mess up to be precise). No need for presentations. All I need is a little passion, creativity, and patience.</p>
        <p>There I was thinking for a story to tell, one that would touch people's hearts, that could change people's minds. I'm no writer or bookworm, but people can clearly tell that I had too high of an ambition. The toll took on me, as hours turned into days and days turned into weeks. I skipped all 3 drafts that I was supposed to fill in, eventually leaving one week left before the deadline.</p>
      
        <p>After a prolonged period of pondering what to write, and changing the story multiple times, I finally decided to write about this, my experience these past 2 years in English class. It may have been a hurricane of trouble and way too much failure from my side, but it has been a memorable experience.</p>
      
        <p>The final day when I had to consult my teacher for the first time, I was shaking in fear the whole day, thinking about everything that could go wrong. I kept delaying my progress to the point I thought my teacher must be infuriated.</p>
      
        <p>To my surprise, she was not mad, or at least didn't seem like it. This whole time all I had to do was just do it, "Yes, Nike, there you go," my teacher responded. It had never been about how perfect my story was, but about how I learned in making it. I might have messed up again this time, but I'm proud to say I've moved a few steps forward.</p>
      
        <p>I'm going to miss this last year...</p>
