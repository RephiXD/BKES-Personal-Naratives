  <h1>Converse and PUMA</h1>
  <p>“Can you stop opening your mouth?”</p>

  <p>That dwarf really shuts me up. I think there's no dwarf that would do that in any films, like "The Hobbit" nor "The Lord of the Rings". I'm older than her, but she really shuts me up? That's insane.</p>

  <p>Every day on Sunday, before going to church, our family always has some sort of conflict, it's like our culture. Not just my mother with my father nor me and my sister. My brother, a big titan with stiff hair, would never, he is a quiet person.</p>

  <p>8.30 AM, with my default alarm ringtone really made me badmood, I always do it every single day, except Saturday, the best day of every week. Cold attacks me even though the blanket envelopes me tightly. I feel it through a hole that is the size of my thumb's toe, I feel it spread all over my body, but abnormally, I feel warm.</p>

  <p>My thoughts every Saturday night, about a "cheerful day on Sunday" got destroyed by the alarm. Not just a frustrating alarm, one little dwarf living in my home, my 13-year-old sister, with her ugly pink ribbon and long black hair, also made me frustrated, but yet grateful.</p>

  <p>We always fight about something that makes us jealous of each other. Food, stuff like money, phones, spoons and forks, and others. And it happens all the time.</p>

  <p>08.59 AM, always one minute before going to church, but this time it was different. We left at 9.10 AM. Why? With small feet, size 37, around nine inches, she protested about her current shoes. She said she doesn't like her shoe anymore, it's like being splashed with mud, dark chocolate on white shoes. Frustrating. She forces and begs my father to buy her a new shoe, of course, 1-star shoe, 'Converse'. The one and only one she loves. Black and white with a lot of big black dots on it and high soled shoes. She begs in great detail, maybe she looked for it before going to bed? While I was thinking about tomorrow, she was probably looking for those converse shoes. I even memorized the details and yeah, it's kinda frustrating.</p>

  <p>I told my father not to buy her new shoes, 'cause she already has a good pair, white and clean, with a little brown, like a spill of melted chocolate on the top of the shoe. Not like mine. Mine are dirty and old sneakers.</p>

  <p>I feel jealous, of course, knowing that my sister can easily ask my father for a new one, even though hers still good and clean. We argued at home, in the car, even in church.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, my father bought us our new shoes. For both of us. Black and white with a lot of big black dots on it and high soled shoes, and white 'PUMA - Snoopy' shoes. It's really surprising to me, but I feel very bad. I really regret arguing with my sister in the car that made my father buy us new shoes. I found out that my father still loves me as much as he loves my sister. I apologize to him and of course, to my lovely dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Going to church on Sunday is supposed to be a cheerful day." That's what I always thought before going to sleep. But now it is different, I wake up with my default alarm ringtone with no bad mood, take a shower, use my birthday gift clothes from my girlfriend and of course my new white 'PUMA - Snoopy' verse shoes, and go to cfhurch.</p>
