  <h1>BKES' Personal Naratives</h1>
  <p>As life goes on, the magic is never-ending. There are times that we climb and times that we descend, times that we build and times that we bend. It won’t last forever, but each chapter of life collides and builds who we are today. We are young, and then we grow. </p>
  <p>The present became the past, and in a heartbeat, the future is now. Knowing that all experiences are meaningful and marked with irreplaceable value, they are treasures worth inheriting. Here, we present different pages of our lives, unfolding one story after another through our narratives. </p>
  <p>The essence of life is to impact. Isn’t it selfish to let our memories shut in a jar instead of letting them echo through the outside world? As those experiences brought colors and melodies to us, we, the authors, hope to spread them to many souls. Just as a resistant gene replicates into many genes after being infected by a virus, so do humans with distinct backgrounds become each other’s antigen, providing the shields that act as the immune system in creating a better generation. </p>
  <p>With pleasure, we invite you to experience our points of view on our past lives. May these simple yet invaluable puzzle pieces from the 23 of us allow you to relate to the tension, excitement of remarkable rides, and the journey that brought us to where we stand today. We hope you have a pleasant reading (journey). </p>
  <p>With love and memories,
  <br>Naomi Adeline</p>
