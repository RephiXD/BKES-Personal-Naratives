  <h1>Fight of the Day</h1>
  
  <p>We had a really big argument. He said, “You shouldn’t pass the ball to me!”. With my smart brain I said “You’re the one who asked for the ball!” I don’t know what I felt at that time, but I was thinking that if he tried to fight with me, I'd be really mad. He came to me, and we had a face to face. Suddenly, he raised and clenched his hands trying to punch me. I also immediately raised my hand and was ready to punch at any time.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine you are a point guard, who became the most important part in basketball offense. Without a point guard, the ball can’t flow through effectively. I’m in a match trying to do my best. I tried to surpass the enemy. I crossed over, spun and passed the ball to one of my teammates because he was asking for the ball, so I passed the ball to him. Our enemies are good enough to compete against us, though; one of them intercepted the pass by extending their hand. They ended up stealing the ball and scored.</p>
  
  <p>My friends immediately took a timeout without the team's consent. Usually, timeouts are the time when we need to correct each other. But my teammate was doing other things. He blamed me for that mistake, but he didn’t want to admit that he’s also wrong for asking for the ball.</p>
  
  <p>So we debated about it.</p>
  
  <p><i>“Stop making stupid decisions!”</i> He said.</p> 

  <p>In my mind, I’m thinking, “He’s the one who asked for the ball, so why should I take the blame?”</p>

  <p>So I countered his argument by saying, “Are you out of your mind? How were those my mistakes?”</p>

  <p>Then he started to make a stance to punch; he only waited for the timing. I was pretty pissed off, so I also made a stance and waited for him to punch first to be able to sue him if he punches me.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, one of my teammates walked in like a boss. He came and separated us like an angel. He calmed both of us down, and started to preach to us.</p>

  <p>He said, <i>"Guys, please calm down! We need to calm down and focus, so we can win this game. Don’t put pressure on each other, but just play like we usually do!”</i></p>

  <p>At first I thought, “Who is this guy?”</p>

  <p>But after I rethought a few times, I realized what we did was wrong. Sometimes, we need to give in to make the situation better; we knew who was really wrong. When I lose control of my anger, everyting became more messed up, but as we let our emotions calm down, things do get better.</p>
