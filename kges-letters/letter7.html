  <h1>Stalling</h1>
  
  <p>As the two hands of the clock unite at its highest peak and the bell’s ringing echoed within the walls of room Primary 3B, Miss Lea’s sentence was halted in a pause. Heaving a sigh, she reluctantly dismissed the class. It only took a second before the door slammed open and students scurried out the room, thrilled to finally scarf down their lunch. Following suit, I clutched my lunchbox to have mine.</p>

  <p>However, as the crowd stampeded towards the canteen, I slipped amongst them to the girls’ third floor bathroom.</p>

  <p>With the lunch-bag clutched tight and the stall locked, I sat atop the cheap plastic lid and slowly unraveled the lunch my mom had packed. The silence was deafening, only the zipper’s metal teeth disengaging filled the void.</p>

  <p>Mom packed scrambled eggs and some new way she cooked chicken. It took her an hour to prepare, but only a second for its scent to taint the pitiful stall. I could only stare at the oddly cooked food and feel the pit in my stomach grow in size.</p>

  <p><i>“That’s a lot of food,”</i> I could imagine her saying with her thin smile and weak laugh. <i>“What even is that? Why does it smell weird?”</i> And I’d reply with a shrug, laughing it off. I'd pin the blame on my mom. I’d treat the pretty brunette’s lingering remarks as jokes.</p>

  <p>But they weren’t <i>just</i> jokes. I knew it. We both knew it.</p>

  <p>The thought of her made the pounding of my heart feel faster and the ringing in my ear intrusive, up until the rhythm of my heartbeat was all I could hear.</p>

  <p>Louder… 
  <br>Then louder...
  <br>Then it was too loud, I couldn't take it. So I ignored it.</p>

  <p>I’d ignore it first by busying myself with the labels taped on the wall, explaining the intricacies of proper bathroom etiquette. I’d ignore it second by analyzing the inside of the toilet tank, inspecting the ins-and-outs of the plumbing. For the most part though, I’d ignore it by consuming myself with silly daydreams and what-ifs.</p>

  <p>My eyelids shut black as I took a deep breath in. In an instant, the stagnant air of the bathroom turned chilly, the dark stall brightened, and the silence turned to a buzzing chatter.</p>

  <p>And for a fleeting second, it all felt real.</p>

  <p>I’d be wearing the national white and gray uniform, my hair would be longer– <i>much</i> longer, perhaps my facial features would look a little better– scattered around my face in an alignment.</p>

  <p>But most importantly, I'd be sitting around friends in the canteen. I'd be eating with them. I'd be smiling and nodding along to whatever topic was on. And, if– for whatever reason I was lucky– I'd be laughing. No more “Why so much food?” or “Isn’t that a lot for lunch?” Less of  “I could never eat that much,” and “Your food honestly looks disgusting.”</p>

  <p>Just comfort, just laughter.</p>

  <p>We’d laugh a little too loud. We’d laugh as food choked in our throats. We’d laugh until our stomachs were writhing in pain. We’d laugh until tears would well up in our eyes– for once not because of them but simply because I was with them.</p>

  <p>Slowly, hot tears would slip out of my eye.</p>

  <p>One at a time, then, all at once.</p>

  <p>I would fall into a silent sob, stalling for a possible ray of change. And I'd do it for a day, for a week, for a year, for a moment, and for what felt like forever.</p>
