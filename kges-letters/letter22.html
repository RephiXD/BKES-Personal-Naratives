  <h1>Why Me?</h1>
  
  <p>“Zaki jadi ketua ya gess!” One of the senior administrators shouted from the corner of the room. All of the eyes in that room, looked at me, straight to my eyes. I looked at that person with the side of my eyes and no expression.</p>

  <p>It was a normal Sunday morning, and I had walked to church as usual. I looked at my phone to see what time it was.</p>

  <p>“Aduh!” I started to run with all of my power. I tried to get to church as fast as I can. It’s 08.35. I should have arrived at 08.30, yet I'm only halfway there. After I arrived, I sat in the back of the room. Another administrator looked at me because I’m late.</p>

  <p>Time flies and all of the administrators gather for a plenary meeting. We evaluated and talked about what to do next month. I started to look at my phone and chat with my friends.</p>

  <p>“Zaki, tadi kita ngebahas apa?” One of the administrators asked me.</p>

  <p>I looked at her and answered, “Bahas kepengurusan selanjutnya.”</p>

  <p>“Iya, ngapain kamu main hp? Taruh hp-nya.”</p>

  <p>I got a little bit upset because of her tone. I put my phone on the table and started listening again. It's been two hours since the meeting started. I looked at the clock. It's 14.37. When will this meeting end?</p>

  <p>“Jadi kita udah diskusi dan nentuin pengurus berikutnya nih.”</p>

  <p>“Ketuanya Zaki ya guyss,” said one of the senior administrators at the corner of the room. I looked at her. No expression, just looked at her. Directly to her eyes. Like, didn't you see me late earlier? I was even on my cell phone during the meeting! What do you mean you appointed me chairman?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, her boyfriend started to clap his hand and said, “Selamat Zaki, kamu ketuanya ya, nanti untuk anggota bakal disusun. Gimana yang lain?” All of the administrators looked at me, the elder too. I just kept quiet and started to look at their eyes.</p>

  <p>“Yey Zaki mau ya guys, jadi sekarang sudah resmi ketuanya Zaki karena Zaki nggak bilang nggak mau,” those senior administrators said again. The meeting room became noisy because of that statement. Without my permission, everyone agreed for me to be the leader of the administrators. I know, I can’t refuse the offer and the decision that is already made by seniors. I know, the elder is the one that agreed too. I know, even if I refuse, the seniors, other administrators, and the elders will force me to become the leader.</p>

  <p>I wanted to refuse. But I can't. I started to think, what should I do after I became the leader. Before this, I became the leader of a committee, and my members looked down on me and I had to work very hard just to work with them. In the next administration, they will become my members again. I hesitate because they all don't take me seriously and respect me. What can I do?</p>

  <p>The meeting is over, I leave the room and start to walk. Suddenly, one of my friends from the administrators called me from behind. I looked at her.</p>

  <p>“Cie jadi ketua, selamat ya.” I just smiled at her. She should be with me as the next administrators. She is one of two administrators that quit. I felt betrayed. From four people that became administrators with me two years ago to three. Now I have to try by myself to become a good leader which will never be achieved.</p>
