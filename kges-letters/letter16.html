  <h1>What A Mango Heist Taught Me</h1>
  
  <p>“KAYTLEEEEEN!!”</p>

  <p>I was 10. Whenever Mom calls me such, it’s trouble. I’d be all angsty, questioning why mothers had to be loud, shouting names with unappealing Indonesian accents. The perfect time to remember I had <i>Ompung.</i></p>

  <p>Here’s a thing about grandmothers; they're actually the “real mothers”. I knew that from Mom’s grayer hair compared to hers. I always thought yellow was <i>Ompung</i>’s color, every nose-scrunch in her smile and bright laughs during my knee injuries came with the grace of that color, never making me feel small. Every gift and teasing had a lesson, which was a part of her patience. And that “patience” was what 10-year-old me took advantage of, at least before she died.</p>

  <p>At that age, my school life still depended on Mom. So even on a sunny Saturday, her frustration sent me straight to <i>Ompung</i>’s house because I couldn’t finish a project. How bad could it be? Ompung would allow more things for me than my own mother anyway.</p>

  <p>So she took me to study in her bedroom. I sat cautiously on her bedside chair, preparing for an easy escape. Evacuation, check. Matching her boredom, I worked slowly, letting her doze off. Target security, check. Then, it was time to have the freedom I “deserved”, not realizing <i>Ompung</i> wasn’t born yesterday when it comes to babysitting.</p>

  <p>Before her death, <i>Ompung</i>’s life was proof that I had a different kind of freedom. Every time I’d do things against my parents' will under her guard, it was like silently telling them, “You can’t say ‘no’ to YOUR mom now, can you?” So I skipped out of the house, into her garden, with that exact freedom in my hands.</p>

  <p>That’s when I saw the tree, the only one bearing only one fruit. I was tempted. A mango, too green-skinned to be picked that early. I thought of making something out of it for her, but you know what I thought was cooler? The knife I cut it with. I was able to throw away my pure intentions for awe towards an awesomely curved, heavy-duty knife I’d never seen before! I could legally call myself armed! That was freedom.</p>

  <p>Off went the mango, cut too harshly by my enthusiasm. Of course, I didn’t realize the damage, because I was too honored to have the kindest Ompung.</p>

  <p><i>“Kekeeeeeeeee!!”</i></p>

  <p>Don’t get me started on how high a <i>bataknese</i> grandmother’s voice can echo throughout a garden. Apparently, she’d been awake the whole time, just to see how stupid I’d be. The only relief? She called me by my nickname. I wasn’t totally in trouble. Or wrong.</p>

  <p><i>“Hadoooohh!!! Mangga guuaaaa!!”</i></p>

  <p>Despite her desperate cry, she came to forgive.</p>

  <p>That’s the thing about <i>Ompung</i>. Yes, scolds may come to shove. But to her, lectures weren’t needed to teach me a lesson. Instead of making me feel small, she showed me something way bigger.</p>

  <p>That 71-year-old beating heart still had its strength to give. Her tough love came through the most bitter <i>rujak</i> I've ever had, made from that unripe mango. Sliced, marinated, but edible enough because I knew it came from her. That’s how she gave; aggressively, assertively, wholeheartedly, abundantly. I didn't fully appreciate it until she died the following year.</p>

  <p>I was overwhelmed by the amount of people at the funeral, further proving how much she gave in life. Hands were shaken, songs sung, fruits and pork eaten like she never left.</p>

  <p>7 years later. The mango tree bears fruit again, but I’ll never dare to pick another. Because here’s another thing about grandmothers; they’re either bitter or sweet. Either way, they last a lifetime in your heart.</p>
