  <h1>Flying in the Island of the Gods</h1>
  
  <p>Do I have superpowers? I was soaring through the air, feeling a tingling rush, until I wasn’t. As my skin hit the ground harshly, all I could think of was, <i>am I going to skip school tomorrow?</i></p>

  <p>It all started when I was savoring the last bite of my brunch at <i>Crate Cafe</i> on my last day in Bali when my mom urged me to check out the stores across the street. The rest of my family weren’t done with their meal, so I went alone.</p>

  <p>Throughout my childhood, my parents repeatedly taught me to check both sides of the street before I cross it. I usually waved it off, joking that I was a professional because I played <i>Crossy Road</i> as if my character didn’t die after every 5 steps.</p>

  <p>As I stepped out of the cafe, I looked to my right, then to my left. With my head still turned left, I confidently took my first step, picturing cute outfits these stores might offer. However, fate had other plans. In an instant, an unknown force hit me in the back. I was swept off my feet, literally. My body was tossed in the hot air. I was flying! Was this what it felt like to be Superman?</p>

  <p>Before I could embrace my short-lived fantasy, reality hit me hard, just like my body hit the rough ground, scraping my skin. I lay on the rocky road, trying to process what had just happened. This has to be a joke. How could I let this happen to myself? I was supposed to go back home to Jakarta in a few hours, yet there I was, lying in the middle of the road with a life almost lost, a thousand kilometers away from home.</p>

  <p>As if it couldn’t get any worse, the embarrassment kicked in. I would've taken the pain over that level of humiliation any day. The accident happened in front of the cafe’s long queue. Three kind-hearted customers sacrificed their spots in line and rushed to help me. They assisted me to my feet and returned my cracked phone and sunglasses that had flown off my head. However, the motorcyclist didn’t even lift a finger. Once I was out of the way, he sped off without apologizing. The audacity!</p>

  <p>As I reentered the cafe, I limped towards my family’s table. They had no idea of what had happened because their table was on the other side of the cafe. My mom’s eyes widened once she laid her eyes on me, “How are you back so fast? Did you spot anything you like?” Oh, she was surprised by my quick return.</p>

  <p>At that point, I hesitated to tell the truth. I feared getting scolded for my recklessness in crossing the street. My body was still shaking from the shock and my knee was stinging, so I finally gathered the courage to say, “I got hit by a motorcycle…”</p>

  <p>My family stared at me with blank faces, making it difficult for me to read their minds. They didn’t believe me until my mom gasped, “Wait, she’s telling the truth! Look, her pants are ripped.”</p>

  <p>My family’s concern shifted from disbelief to relief. I finally let go of the breath I was holding in for what felt like forever. Imagine having to convince your family that you nearly lost your life, with your ripped pants being the only unspoken witness. I may have joked too much, making anything that comes out of my mouth seem unbelievable. In the end, it wasn’t just about my crazy story, but about how unpredictable life is.</p>
