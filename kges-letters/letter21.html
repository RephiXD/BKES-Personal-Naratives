  <h1>The First Place</h1>
  
  <p>At the beginning of September, Sky entered my life. My relationship with him started with simple talks, but as time went on, those “simple talks” brought us to something deeper — something familiar.</p>
  
  <p>It didn’t take long for him to say, “I love you.”</p>

  <p>Something warm yet cold crawled from my guts through my epigastrium. I never thought I’d have butterflies in my stomach. But deep down, an unpleasant feeling bothered my insides. However, I decided to shove it away, enjoying the love he’s giving to me.</p>

  <p>We had a date and my hair was messy when I arrived. He smiled and touched my hair, tidying it up for me. We picked a horror movie to watch and there were times when I got scared. Whenever it happens, he closes my eyes with his warm hand. After the movie date, we called and played games at night.</p>

  <p>That day with him boosted my oxytocin levels like a rocket. The way he talked and hugged, everything about it was sweet. But the sweetness felt like an imitation of something I’ve had before. The way he looked at me and talked in that soft voice, being clingy like a little boy, reminds me of that moment.</p>

  <p>His name is Nathan, a guy I was in a situationship with before. A week before I had to move to Jakarta for school, he talked with me for the last time. He pleaded to me, his big doe eyes and soft deep voice begging me to stay while holding my cold hand. When I had to go, he hugged me in a way I couldn’t understand. Afterward, we separated because I couldn’t hold the long distance between us.</p>

  <p>As I continued reminiscing the memories with Nathan, Sky cut me off, “Please stop talking about him, I don’t like it.”</p>

  <p>My words got stuck behind my throat, my brain stopped working. I knew I achieved new knowledge about him, and my instincts alerted me, a red siren blaring inside my head.</p>

  <p>“Ok, we’re done then. Bye.” He hung up the 4-hour-long call with cold words, colder than my 16°C AC at 2 A.M. in the room.</p>

  <p>His words struck like thunder through my empty head and my heart felt like it was being scraped, bleeding continuously. I stared at my lock-screen blankly, looking at the clock and empty notification. I didn’t care, I thought I’d be okay.</p>

  <p>But I wasn't.</p>

  <p>I became lifeless, alive but not living, breathing but dead. I couldn‘t even cry and once I did, I cried in silence to hide everything from everyone.</p>

  <p>I realized, all this time, I still haven’t moved on from the first place. I’ve been busy looking for someone like Nathan without thinking clearly. I longed for the warmth and sweetness he gave, and it’s been two years since we were separated, but the ghost of him weighed me down.</p>

  <p>I called my Mom and told her about everything.</p>

  <p>“You wander looking for love out there, that’s why you feel lonely. Why would you forget about God that could fulfill your whole life? You’re being too self-centered.”</p>

  <p>Her words pierced me like an arrow, bruising it to its depths. It pains me, but she’s right. I couldn’t help but cry in my prayer begging for help. I tried to let go of all my problems and put God in the first place, whatever it takes. I believe He knows me better than I do.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I still can’t let him go.</p>
