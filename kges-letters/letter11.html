  <h1>Fragmented Snowflakes & Hearts</h1>
  
  <p>"Lukie? Is that you?"</p>

  <p>My heart thumped rapidly. I find myself feeling unsure, could this be the boy I once shared the world with, or just another stranger. When those familiar blue eyes met mine, my heart sank to the depths of the Mariana Trench. Yet there he was, idly standing.</p>

  <p>All year, I had eagerly anticipated our annual family holiday trip, until my mom announced "Woop woop, we're going to Tokyo, again!"</p>

  <p>My face dropped. Four years have passed since I last saw Lukas, and with each visit to Tokyo it was mandatory that I see my old friends, which includes him.</p>

  <p>At the end of December, Narita Airport was covered in thick white fluffy snow. As soon as our plane landed, a knot of anxiety twisted in my stomach.</p>

  <p>On New Year's Eve, like any other big metropolitan city, Tokyo is at its peak busyness. Fashion enthusiasts were crazily hunting down piles of half-priced designer coats.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, I was on the lookout for a black coat, standing about 6 feet tall, complemented with streaking blonde hair.</p>

  <p>"Kee? You wear glasses now?"</p>

  <p>I barely could recognize him, he looked so different from back when we shared laughs in 8th grade.</p>

  <p>Anyways, it was almost dinnertime. Lukas suggested a trending ramen shop, which was “just twenty minutes away,” he recalled.</p>

  <p>As we then navigated through districts of Shibuya Ward, none of us wanted to break the ice. We once had things in common, now the only thing we share is the winter breeze that night, we were both ice cold.</p>

  <p>I was willing to let Lukas break the silence first. But at 2°C, I burst out like snowflakes.</p>

  <p>"Why would you ever suddenly disappear like that? Why did you ghost me, Lukas?" I yelled infuriatingly.</p>

  <p>The silence that followed was deafening.</p>

  <p>"Kee, what? I never meant to hurt you," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You're a coward!" I shouted. Four years of silence erupted into a storm of blame.</p>

  <p>The arguments escalated swiftly. Until, I noticed his face was turning pale white. His breaths became shallow.</p>

  <p>“Lukas?” Anxiety gripped me as I realized he was spiraling.</p>

  <p>His hands trembled. A tear shed from his right eye. I shook him tenderly by the shoulders, over and over. "Look at me. Breathe, okay? Breathe. I'm sorry.”</p>

  <p>I had always known about Lukas’ ADHD, but a panic attack on New Year's Eve?</p>

  <p>Time stretched as I focused on his breathing. As it steadied down, his eyes looked up to me, filled with tears. “I’m sorry too, Kee.”</p>

  <p>The ice between us melted down as I pulled him into a hug. “I cared a lot about us. Our relationship. Our future plans. I really did,” I cried out.</p>

  <p>What? We were lost in a whirlwind of emotions for almost four years?</p>

  <p>This was never the closure I had envisioned. The least thing I wanted to do on this trip was getting somebody into a panic attack. I felt awful.</p>

  <p>Yet if it wasn't for this tragedy, I would never find a more profound closure either.</p>

  <p>With the understanding that we had both been hurt, but we had also both survived, I knew it would be a new beginning for the both of us - a platonic friendship or another romantic relationship? I wouldn’t know for now.</p>

  <p>Because we decided to break the ice, echoes of our past can now resonate with the promises of tomorrow. Never be so scared to water your ice.</p>
