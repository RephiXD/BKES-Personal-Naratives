  <h1>Never Good Enough</h1>
  
  <p>The sky was bright blue that day, adorned with white fluffy clouds. A warm summer breeze came in through the front door and sun rays streamed through the windows, illuminating the front corridor’s couch where I was curled up, crying.</p>
  
  <p>“Why are you so lazy? It would help if you were more like your friend. She practices every single day without anyone asking her to!”</p>

  <p>How could he? How could my father say that? Am I, his daughter, not good enough for him? Why are my parents always, always comparing me to their friends’ children? To my friends? Why can’t they see that it’s doing more harm than good?</p>

  <p>Painful memories started flooding into my head. My fingers trembled. Tears started streaming down my face even more. I squeezed my folded arms so hard that my nails started digging into my skin, hoping that it would calm me down. It didn’t work. Grunts of frustration came out of my mouth instead.</p>

  <p>I’d been trying so hard to be the best at everything for as long as I can remember. Straight A’s no longer felt special. Of course they never felt special. My parents never cared enough to praise me anyway. Practicing piano was never fun. Tears fell with each key I pressed. My ears rang with the sound of my mother yelling. My arms sore from holding my fingers in position so they wouldn’t lay flat. I wouldn’t dare let my fingers rest. Mother would shout even more.</p>

  <p>Mind you, I was only six when all of this started. Six!! You have no idea how jealous I was seeing my friends spending their weekends going to fun places I’ve never been to. After all, I’d been spending my Saturdays at music classes since I was in kindergarten, then at piano lessons with my very strict and demanding teacher right after my sixth birthday.</p>

  <p>I’d thought about quitting piano a million times already. I really did. I couldn’t stand being at my teacher’s house. The dark atmosphere inside suffocates me everytime, warning me to get ready for all the horrible things I’d have to face during the next two hours.</p>

  <p>“IDIOT!! Do you ever practice? Are you not ashamed of yourself? My other student, a year younger than you, has finished learning this piece already!”
  <br>“Christians shouldn’t be this dumb. Are you even a Christian?”
  <br>“You’re just a lazy girl burdening her parents. You’ll never succeed in life.”</p>

  <p>Despite that, everytime I told my parents the things my teacher said to me and how that made me want to quit, all my parents did was gaslight me to think everything about this was normal, saying that’s just how old people teach.</p>

  <p>No one had ever been on my side. No one has ever said, “I’m proud of you”. Or maybe someone did? If so, I can’t remember. It’d been too long. Was it wrong for me to have a little hope that someday I’ll finally be seen? When will all of my hard work pay off? God, please put me out of this misery.</p>

  <p>As I continued to bawl my eyes out, heavy footsteps approached the corridor. It was my father. Probably here to spew out more nonsense. </p>

  <p>“I didn’t mean to compare you to your friend. I only meant that you should learn to practice more often from her.”</p>

  <p>Same old, same old. Of course, I couldn’t say anything else to defend myself. It would be pointless anyway. Everything I do. Everything I say. Everything I try to achieve. None of that would ever be good enough.</p>
