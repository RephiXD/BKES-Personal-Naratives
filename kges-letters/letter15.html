  <h1>Right in the Breadbasket</h1>
  
  <p>A swing to the gut can do serious damage. It did to me, but I wasn’t that unfortunate.</p>

  <p>There I was, wearing my thick gray jacket covering my freshly stitched belly. With sloth-like speed, I went out of the car, waddling to the school lobby with Mom’s hand supporting my body.</p>

  <p>“Wait here while I talk to Ibu Tari, okay”, said Mom whilst helping me sit in the school lobby.</p>

  <p>“You won’t be mad at Kiel, right Ma? He did kick me though, but–”</p>

  <p>“Hush! Sit down or your stitches will bust right open!”</p>

  <p>Then off she went to the counseling room, leaving me in that giant lobby.</p>

  <p>I drained my thoughts into a sinkhole for a moment.</p>

  <p>It was brown-eye’s swing that admitted me into this sterile ward with appendicitis. I didn’t expect a genuine blow that an after-class play-pretend session of Spider-Man could give me.</p>

  <p>His strike didn’t put a bruise on my breadbasket or scars on my paunch, yet it was the one that caused my month of hell in the ER. My senses heightened whenever a doctor or nurse entered, hoping their pager wouldn’t summon me back to the OR. Though anesthesia blurred my vision, I clearly heard Dad yelling because I woke up post-surgery.</p>

  <p>My scream could’ve woken the dead.</p>

  <p>Despite relaxing on the hospital bed with chocolate cake, my PSP, and Open Season, the pain of being unable to move my legs for two days crushed my playful spirit.</p>

  <p>With all the pain and missed classes, I’d be feebleminded to not expect that the first person who’d instantly get thrown under the bus was the perpetrator I call a friend. But after my despair, he’s still my friend that <i>did not</i> hurt me!</p>

  <p>How would he know that? He could be expelled! I had to tell Mom.</p>

  <p>Ugh! Those two moms across from me couldn’t mind their own business, staring like I’d been sent to timeout for marching to my own beat. If only they knew I’d just come back from a month in a prison-like infirmary.</p>

  <p>Whatever. I got up anyway. With both hands on the handle of the blue rugged chair, I stood up and waddled.</p>

  <p>Seeing Mom approach brown-eyes’ class raised my eyebrows higher than the stars, knocking my socks off. I had to go there!</p>

  <p>Never have I felt like such a tortoise in a race!</p>

  <p>The teacher was pulling him out of class, holding his arm, leading him near the toilet to chat with Mom. My slothful speed couldn’t keep up with my beating heart.</p>

  <p>I could already picture his head locked in, tilting down, his hands intertwined, all the while holding immense streams of tears.</p>

  <p>Yet all I saw was a thankful pair of eyes looking up, followed by a shoulder-pat.</p>

  <p>I was shocked.</p>

  <p>Was Mom just being nice? Was she just hiding the fact that my friend really did me harm?</p>

  <p>She walked past him, weirdly thanked him, said goodbye, then walked out with me to the car.</p>

  <p>I was bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd be mad at him, Ma."</p>

  <p>"Remember your uncle, how his appendix burst? That would’ve happened to you,--worse--if it weren’t for Kiel’s kick”, she said while clouding my judgement with utter paradox.</p>

  <p>How can a kick save my life? Did my fate truly depend on an accident?</p>

  <p>Science proved it; my gut needed such pressure to prevent it from exploding. But I hadn’t expected it to arrive at just the right moment.</p>

  <p>As astonishing as it can be, sometimes, the blow that feels like it could break you is the very one that saves you.</p>
