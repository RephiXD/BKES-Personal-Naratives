  <h1>First Day of Hell</h1>
  
  <p><i>Books—check. 
  <br>Stationeries—check. 
  <br>Uniform—check.</i></p>

  <p>I took one last look in the mirror and brushed my freshly cut bangs to prevent them from splitting like my friendships, preparing myself for what I liked to call: the first day of hell.</p>

  <p>I’ve always despised school.</p>

  <p>But in that dark, torturous place where every shred of hope meets its end, a few lights began to form a sun, melting all the misery with its warm and gentle glow.</p>

  <p>Those lights were my friends, my sun, who would always be there for me through both the happy and difficult times.</p>

  <p>I was never alone.</p>

  <p>But everything changed when my friends moved to a different school. Every. Single. One of them. That same sun would never rise again.</p>

  <p>And that awful reality began today.</p>

  <p>A new year just started. Once again, I shook hands with the front door and entered the dim room I knew all too well. Dozens of titled chairs were arranged with a bunch of unfamiliar faces sitting on them. The cold, unwelcoming stares greeted me as I sat down and glanced around.</p>

  <p>I quickly noticed one guy with camel-like lashes that reminded me of when my best friend joked that we were failures as women. Couldn’t have agreed more. I silently wished for someone who would remotely resemble my friends, but instead, I got a kid who was the spitting image of someone I despised back in 7th grade. And compared to my friends, these people had no taste. One guy literally had broccoli-shaped hair. What could be worse than that?</p>

  <p>Same school, same room—different people.</p>

  <p><i>Tik-tok, Tik-tok</i></p>

  <p><i>Ba-dump, ba-dump</i></p>

  <p>I could almost feel the blood pulse beneath my skin synchronizing with my wristwatch. My throat desperately yearned for that last drop of saliva in my mouth.</p>

  <p>I looked to my left. No one. Then right. No one. There’s no one to talk to. None.</p>

  <p>I was all alone.</p>

  <p>Making new friends felt like my only lifeline. But as soon as I tried to open my mouth, no words came out.</p>

  <p style="font-style:italic;"> Wait, what am I supposed to say?
  <br>This isn’t some sort of school play.
  <br>There's no script to follow. 
  <br>One word could determine everything.
  <br>What if they think I’m weird, or creepy??
  <br>Argh!! How do you make friends?? </p>

  <p><i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>Wait... How do friendships even start?</i></p>

  <p>I tried to recall all the moments we shared. From when we poured our hearts over the same crush from a TV show. Or the time when we used weird code names for our girl talk. To the sting from accidentally offending my friend, earning my first slap across the face.</p>

  <p>But despite everything, we would always forgive one another as our friendship grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Our flaws, mistakes, and errors—made our friendship stronger. It wasn’t perfect, so maybe I didn’t need to be perfect today either.</p>

  <p>The worries that were swarming my thoughts began to clear up. I clenched my fist, took a deep breath, and regained my composure.</p>

  <p><i>Start over.</i></p>

  <p>I scanned the people who would soon be part of my high school life. Hoping that I could find someone who could be the new sun to rise upon my day. I noticed a girl with long hair beside me, waiting for someone to talk to her. I took the chance and made eye contact. I took a deep breath and prepared myself.</p>

  <p>Everything starts with a simple question.</p>

  <p>“Hi! What’s your name?”</p>
