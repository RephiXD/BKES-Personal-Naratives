  <h1>I Love Her</h1>
  
  <p>“What if I still like you?” I asked her about it and she was shocked at that moment.</p>

  <p>In the morning blue sky, I felt enthusiastic that morning. That day, she and I wanted to go to one of the book fairs. She loves books. I, on the other hand, don’t. I wanted to go that day because she asked me to accompany her to the exhibition.</p>

  <p>That morning I picked her up. I was at a loss; words ran through my mind but I couldn't focus or think. I thought to myself “Wow, she is so pretty, her silky hair, with her t-shirt and skirt, her bright face and the scent of her perfume is nice.”</p>

  <p>When sentences began slipping out of her, I felt my heart start to pound against my chest. The jittery feeling ran from my arms to the tips of my fingers. If it weren’t for the steering wheel, I wouldn’t know what to do with the overwhelming rush of emotions. I couldn’t even look at her, because if I did, I knew I’d say the wrong things and all of this would be over before it even started. I tried to speak up, even though I was afraid that my conversation would be awkward.</p>

  <p>We talked about many things. It was like a dream to be able to talk with her that day. I want to talk to her all the time, even if I don't know what I want to say.</p>

  <p>We finally arrived at the book fair. There, I accompanied her to look for interesting books. With a spark of interest myself, I asked her to give me recommendations for books that I should read.  After a long time looking for books, she got some that she wanted.</p>

  <p>After we finished buying books, we wanted to eat. We bought fries and ice cream then ate in the car. After we finished eating, we headed back to her house.</p>

  <p>On the way back, we talked about many things. I spoke to her fluently and she replied with her voice that always made me smile during the trip. Until one moment I asked, “What if I still like you?”</p>

  <p>“No way,” She replied, “Do you actually still like me?” She was shocked and silent as she waited for my answer. I nervously answered, “Yes, I still like you”. After that, she asked me why I still liked her until we finally arrived at her house and we parted ways. I don't know what I was thinking at the time.</p>

  <p>On one hand, I felt like an idiot. I didn’t know what I was thinking that day. I knew that she didn't like me back, but I still confessed my feelings for the second time. It felt like someone injected me with some sort of strong elixir that sent me a jolt of courage to say that I liked her. It was stupid, really. I knew saying so would make us even more of a stranger than we already are. Not to mention the further awkwardness of talking at school.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, I was very happy because I was able to talk to her a lot that day and spend the day with her. Even though she didn't like me back, we still became friends. She changed many things about me and I learned to respect her feelings.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was stupid. But regardless of that, it was true. I still did love her and I will continue to love her. Now and, if I had the chance, forever.</p>
