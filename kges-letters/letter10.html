  <h1>Last Chance</h1>
  
  <p>My grandpa and I used to spend a lot of time together daily. At home, we enjoyed watching movies, pretending to play chef and singing together. In the afternoon, sometimes he would sing Mandarin songs upstairs and I would often join in, listening to his melodious voice. However, I haven't experienced any of that since he got sick. We can't do that anymore, but I hope one day I can feel that again.</p>

  <p>Until one day that hope was lost.</p>

  <p>The morning was young and the sound of urgent footsteps thundering up the stairs woke me up from my slumber. Suddenly, my door slammed open and my father stood by the doorway. His face was pale and I could barely hear his voice when he said, “Cia, akung udah pergi.”</p>

  <p>The world stopped. At least it did for me because my grandpa meant the world to me.</p>

  <p>No amount of words could describe how long I stayed silent. My mind was spinning like a whirlwind and my heart was trying to convince myself that no, akung is not gone. When the fact sank in, the silence was finally broken by the sound of my sobs.</p>

  <p>The incident was very unexpected because the doctor said he could still survive for a few months. Who knew that he would go this quickly? I held his cold feet to make sure this was real. The first thing that came to my mind was that I failed to keep my promise to him before he left.</p>

  <p>I often accompanied him to his room when I came home from school. A day before he left, I did the same despite being tired. In the room, some people were accompanying him while eating. My mother asked me to sing a song for my grandpa so that he would feel entertained. I refused to sing a song because I didn’t have the energy to do it. After he fell asleep, we went out where my mother asked me to talk.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you want to sing for Grandpa?" I said I was tired.</p>

  <p>Then she said to do it next time, to make him feel comfortable and to have the presence of good company. We wanted to cheer him up despite all the pain he was going through. I promised to sing next time. Little did I know, that was my last chance to sing him a song.</p>

  <p>He was the type of person who cared a lot about small and simple things, such as helping us when we got swollen, giving fans when the heat was unbearable, and many more. He gave me a pillow and blanket when I fell asleep in his room. However, now I can’t feel that anymore because that figure is no longer at home. I miss spending time with him, sometimes I still stop by his room and look at his photos with his sweet smile.</p>

  <p>One of the things he taught me that I could never forget was the song “Jesus Loves Me” in Mandarin. He liked singing while reading books. When he sang, I followed along while mumbling the wrong words, jokingly. He then offered to teach me Mandarin songs. He chose that song because it was pretty simple and meaningful for a child. He taught me one sentence each day so that I could easily remember. Every time I miss him, I always sing that song to reminisce about his voice.</p>

  <p>To this day, tears fill my eyes whenever I hear that song because I can hear the voice I deeply miss.</p>
