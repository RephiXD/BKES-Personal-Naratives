  <h1>Bitter Sausages</h1>
  
  <p>From the roasted whiff of grilled cheese to the distinct blissful aroma of Indomie and the sweet scents of ice cream, the air in the canteen smelled like a bouquet of umami. The canteen was hot but lively, filled with students chatting and bursting in laughter. I took in the atmosphere, gazing outside the window, adoring the bright blue sky adorned with wisps of clouds.</p>

  <p>Just when I was looking around, I noticed my friends holding similar plastic wraps.</p>

  <p>“What’s that?” I asked.
  <br>“Oh, this?” Vivi raised her plastic wrap. “Sausages,” she replied.</p>

  <p>It was one long sausage with several cuts in the middle, clearly having been bathing in hot, bubbling oil. The edges were crispy and darker in color, while the insides were still smoking and moist.</p>

  <p>I was drooling over it until Vivi took a bite, halting my dreams.</p>

  <p>“You can buy it over there, you know,” she said, her voice muffled as she stuffed the rest of the sausage into her mouth. “It’s only Rp10,000.”</p>

  <p>Only Rp10,000. And how much do I have? 0.</p>

  <p>My eyes shut with disappointment but opened with determination.
  <br><i>I’m going to ask my Mama for money.</i></p>

  <p>I pleaded to Mama for money as soon as she picked me up from school. But when she told me to ask Papa, I knew that was a hard <i>no</i> for me.</p>

  <p>My fist clenched.</p>

  <p><i>Dramatic parents. What's wrong with having some sausages? All my friends are eating them. So why can’t I?</i></p>

  <p><i>But you know what? It has always been like this. Everyone else always has cool things that I don’t have.</i></p>
  
  <p><i>After all, I just want sausages. They’re cheap and not a big deal.</i></p>

  <p>Every time I wanted something, Mama would bombard me with her dramatic childhood stories. She said she had to eat only rice, salt, and sweet soy sauce to live and that one of her six siblings died getting hit by a truck because he was complaining about wanting to buy a new belt and wasn’t aware of the busy road.</p>

  <p><i>So what? I don’t care.</i></p>

  <p>So, on a Saturday, under the cover of twilight, I crept down to their dimly lit bedroom</p>

  <p>My heart pounded as I approached the forbidden cabinet in the corner, its shiny silver handle glinting like a beacon.</p>

  <p><i>The money’s definitely inside.</i></p>

  <p>With trembling fingers, I pried it open.</p>

  <p>When I looked inside, I saw no money. Frantic, I scattered everything. My heart raced, and my stomach churned. I felt like I was about to vomit.</p>

  <p>Then I saw it — a stack of pink valuable papers in the corner.</p>

  <p>I grabbed two and bolted away, never looking back.</p>

  <p>The problem was, I didn’t tidy up and close the cabinet.</p>

  <p>The next day, the sky hung like a sullen, gray curtain, obscuring the sun. Mama didn’t speak to me as she picked me up from school. The ride home was tense, the silence as heavy as the storm clouds overhead.</p>

  <p>At home, Papa was waiting by the door, his anger and disappointment palpable.</p>

  <p>As I approached, he took a step towards me and swung his hand.</p>

  <p>A sharp sting was felt at the back of my head — <i>Papa hit me.</i></p>

  <p>I held my head as I stumbled back, tears streaming from my eyes.</p>

  <p>“It’s not about the things you want, it’s about the things you need,” Papa said coldly. “In the bathroom, 2 hours timeout.”</p>

  <p>So there I was, weeping in the corner of the damp, pitch-black bathroom for 2 hours.</p>

  <p>Oh, the sausages? They tasted bitter, like Papa’s punch.</p>
