  <h1>The World Doesn't Want Me To Move On</h1>
  
  <p>“Okay, I think we all should move on to the next topic.”</p>

  <p>Huh? What do you mean? I swore my mind only drifted into another world for less than a minute, thinking about whether or not a Japanese chicken curry sounds good for dinner. Oh my, I bet I looked dumb thinking about it when the class moved ahead. Now I need to discuss a new topic? I haven’t even shared my opinions on the previous one. I mean it’s not like I wanted to share, but I do think it’s necessary to say something for the sake of “contribution”. </p>

  <p>Alright, it’s okay. I can just catch up… right?</p>

  <p>Oh, uh...</p>

  <p>Am I living in slow motion, or is the world racing by?
  <br>Or even worse, is it both?</p>

  <p>I notice my heart starting to beat a little too fast. My chest feels tight like someone is squeezing it every breath I take. The pressure to keep up with other people’s pace lingers, it makes everything feel so overwhelming. I hate this feeling–I hate it so much. </p>

  <p>“Why do people move on so fast?” is the ultimate question I can’t seem to answer, at least not now, not then, not ever. I don’t understand why they can shift to new things so quickly while I’m still here replaying old conversations in my head, dwelling on details that others barely notice, and trapped in the same old spot. I feel dumb not knowing how to cope with it.</p>

  <p><i>“TRING TRINGGG”</i> the bell’s noise fills every corner in this room, interrupting Mr. Anthony as if it’s signaling him to end the class. I reach for my notebook and quickly shove it into my backpack so I can exit the class faster.</p>

  <p>Then, I see her with lips curled upward, a genuine smile lighting up her face. It’s funny to see her living her life to the fullest even though we’re going through a friendship break-up at the same time. There was no big fight, but I still remember the day she stopped replying to my messages and decided to leave our group chat. 
She gets a lot of good things now–new friends, good grades, etc. The question hits me harder: how could she move on so effortlessly? I tried to be like her. I pushed myself to be as happy and successful as she appears to be, thinking that if I could just match her pace, I’d be able to move on too. Yet here I am, standing still.</p>

  <p>But as time went on, nothing seemed to change. The more I compare, the more I lose sight of who I am. Maybe, just maybe, moving on isn’t a real thing. It’s just a blurry concept I kept reaching for but never quite grasping.</p>

  <p>As soon as I arrive at home, I feel a sense of relief wash over me. My bag slips from my shoulder as I head to the bedroom. I grab my phone, scrolling through videos without much thought. My thumb moves automatically, not really focused on anything.</p>

  <p>But then, a line of text flickers on-screen, simple yet striking. I pause. Something about it feels different, like a gentle nudge–a reminder I didn’t know I needed. The words settle into my mind, not demanding, just there.</p>

  <p>For the first time in a while, the noises inside my head disappear.</p>

  <p>All this time, I’m just being me. I’m not behind. I was never behind. I’m just living with my own flow, letting things happen as they should. </p>

  <p>Oh! And I don’t think I want to try racing the world ever again.</p>
