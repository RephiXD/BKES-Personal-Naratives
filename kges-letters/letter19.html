  <h1>I Can Do It</h1>
  
  <p>“Zio! Apa yang jadi masalah? Lu takut? Takut apa?” 
  <br>“Takut di block ko.”</p>

  <p>With heavy breathing and tired legs, I was shouted at by my coach. I wasn’t surprised, I knew it was my fault.</p>

  <p>“Lu harus percaya sama diri lu, selama ini gw jadiin lu starter karena apa? Karena gw percaya sama lu!”
  <br>“Iya ko.”
  <br>“Gw udah kasih lu kepercayaan, lu balikin dengan main bagus dong!”</p>

  <p>In about two weeks, the biggest basketball tournament for high schoolers is starting, and I initially felt calm and unbothered. However, as the date approached, my anxiety began to build. My mind was flooded with worries: “What if I play badly?” “I need to perform at my best.” “What if I miss an open shot?” These thoughts weighed heavily on me.</p>

  <p>To prepare, our team had a practice game against SMAK 3. We started poorly, and I was struggling even more. During the game, I had a moment that exemplified my lack of confidence. I grabbed a rebound and sprinted down the court. With only me, Zovan, an opponent, and the basket left, I hesitated. My heart was racing, and instead of taking the shot myself, I passed the ball to Zovan. I should have made a decisive move and scored, but fear and intimidation caused me to back down, giving the responsibility to Zovan.</p>

  <p>As the game went on, I continued to face opportunities but faltered each time. I had an open lane to the basket, and even though an opponent was nearby, he didn’t make a move to challenge me. Instead of taking the straightforward shot, I attempted a difficult technique and missed. I tried the same approach three times, each attempt ending in failure. I felt embarrassed and frustrated with myself.</p>

  <p>During halftime, my coach called me aside.</p>
  
  <p>“Zio lagi, Zio lagi! Dribble lepas, defense fouling! Bisa apa lu?”</p>

  <p>It became clear that the issue wasn’t just with my technique or the pressure of the game but with my self-belief. I realized that my lack of trust in myself was the real problem. It wasn’t about forcing new techniques but about having confidence in my abilities and making decisions with conviction. Conviction is what I need to perform better. If I believe that I can make a difference, I can defend well, and make my team win.</p>

  <p>With this newfound understanding, I changed my mindset. I acknowledged my capabilities and decided to focus on supporting my teammates. Even when I was on the bench, I stayed engaged and encouraged everyone on the court. I cheered for good plays and strong defense, reminding myself that basketball is a team sport. When one of my teammates was sprinting with the ball and attacking the ring, I screamed and gave more positive vibes to the bench. It went very well for me and the team. By focusing on positive contributions and believing in my role, I managed to shift my energy and approach the game with a better attitude. I knew that my confidence and support for the team were just as valuable as my performance on the court.</p>

  <p>When I was subbed in, my confidence went up. Handling the ball didn’t scare me anymore. I created opportunities for myself and, instead of passing out, I took a shot from beyond the three-point line. Swish! It was nothing but net. Immediately I thought “I really can do it, I am able and he believed in me.” My heart was cheering and I was shouting happily inside myself, but I didn’t show it outside. I knew that shot I made was not going to cover up my mistakes from the whole entire game but I realized that if I do believe in myself, I can do it.</p>
