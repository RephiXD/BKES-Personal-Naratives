  <h1>One to Three</h1>
  
  <p>I waited for my cue to take three steps forward and felt the tension in my chest rise as I counted:</p>
  
  <p>One,
  <br>two,
  <br>three.</p>

  <p>My heartbeat thumped hard as a bead of chilly sweat trickled down my temple, and I could’ve sworn I heard it hit the ground. I looked down in an attempt to haul my focus back by staring at my gray ragged socks. They were on the verge of showing my hallux that rested on top of the icy marbled white floor. Haunting gazes trained towards me, and I felt them slowly creep up my shoulders.</p>

  <p>“<i>I can’t</i>”, echoed throughout the vacant abyss of my mind that once fostered every single line I read from the thirty-paged script. I'm supposed to scream—a frustrated, ear-piercing scream that I’ve practiced for months, but not a single sound or breath slipped past my lips. Chimes teemed in my ears; silence taunted me.</p>

  <p>My surroundings became a vivid reality, the indigo ingrained on both my knees and the sheer cold smearing my disheveled face. I felt the first drop of a tear slide down my cheek, then another, and another. Tears engulfed me, blurring my sight as I submerged into my gale of catastrophe.</p>

  <p><i>I can’t do it.</i></p>

  <p>It became evident that the four words were true, that I was still standing inside the cold auditorium in silence, surrounded by colorless plaster. I can slowly feel myself lose grasp of the character I was supposed to channel. The thrill of her passion, her anger, her frustration—why? Why was I stuck in this constant loop of doubt?</p>

  <p>“Focus.” A firm, yet bitter voice muttered in front of me.</p>

  <p>I’m trying, I really am. I tried so hard to memorize each word and emotion I was supposed to convey but I couldn’t. Maybe it was the annoying whine of the air conditioner that resembled the voices in the back of my head telling me that I wasn’t fit for this role. I had it all under control, I knew the right emotions to use for each line and I landed the role. I cried on cue!</p>

  <p>When did I start losing grasp on everything?</p>

  <p>I couldn’t get a proper grip on my emotions and it felt like I was thirteen again, an oblivious kid who had no idea how to balance her bike. As if one side of the bike felt heavier than the other, her grip would loosen and she’d fall.</p>

  <p>But thirteen-year-old me wasn’t afraid to keep pedaling, even if her knees turned crimson. Every single time she met the craggy road, she’d hold the bike handle harder next round. Instead of backing out or hitting the brakes midway, she took a deep breath before reciting “One more time!” in her head and counted to three.</p>

  <p>One,
  <br>two,
  <br>three.</p>

  <p>Off she went, pedaling, not with the lingering fear of falling—but with the summer breeze cruising by her side as the sidewalks brimmed with greenery cheered on.</p>

  <p>It took her two weeks to learn how to ride a bike.
  <br>I had two weeks of practice left, and I had to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>The blaring air conditioner that once sounded like whining, turned into a hum—a tune for a balmy biking session that carried away my previous state of tumult. I fisted my palms until my knuckles were as white as the floor I stood on.</p>

  <p><i>I can do this.</i></p>

  <p>I took a few steps back and inhaled the crusty auditorium air that somehow felt refreshing.</p>

  <p>I counted to three.</p>

  <p>One,
  <br>two,
  <br>three.</p>
