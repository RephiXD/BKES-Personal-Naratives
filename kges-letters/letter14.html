  <h1>6 Years</h1>
  
  <p>It was on our way home from church that I was bored in the car. All silent, usual jammed roads, and a grayish blue sky makes me feel that nothing interesting is gonna happen. Hoping to get some entertainment, I took my phone, opened it up, swiped right twice, and pressed at the app with a female archer as its icon. It is a game that I have been playing since 2016 called ‘Mobile Legends: Bang Bang’.</p>

  <p>“COME ON phone, keep lagging, KEEP LAGGING I said!” I said in the car sarcastically with quite a big volume.</p>

  <p>My father then quickly turned his head around, looked at me fiercely in the eye and shouted, “DON'T PLAY GAMES THEN! DELETE ALL OF THEM!”</p>

  <p>I was confused but then denied that because I know that the problem is due to its old age and that the storage was full. However, nothing goes to my dad’s ears. He then forced me to delete all my stuff including images, videos, and audios. I really wanted to object, but what can I do, this is my dad. So, I deleted all of them and restart my phone to zero. I saw app by app, picture by picture, album by album, for the last time as I pressed the factory reset button.</p>

  <p>Later at home, I go to my bed, laying up facing the ceiling, staring at it, and remembering all the fun that I had with my friends contained in that phone. It was so painful that it made me cry. I was hopeless and can’t think of any way to get it back. It is gone, all my memories with primary and junior high friends are gone. Then, all the guilt suddenly felt heavy, all the tears started flowing through my eyes once more. I screamed, hugging my bolster as hard as I could to my face to cover all the tears. Then, in the middle of a hopeless stare, I heard a knock.</p>

  <p>There was a knocking sound and a voice started speaking. “Ce? Are you there?” Hearing that, I Immediately recognized that soothing yet firm voice. It was my mom. She opened the door and sat next to me and asked “So tell me, what exactly happened?”</p>

  <p>“I… I just wanted to play games. Then… it…it lagged and so I said ‘keep lagging’ kinda out loud. Dad then heard it and… and told me to delete all my stuff to free my storage. I already told h… him, it is an old phone from 6 years ago, but… but he would not listen,” I said, sobbing.</p>

  <p>“It is okay, it is fine. Come here, hug mommy.” She said that as I hugged her dearly while crying.</p>

  <p>“Would you like a new phone then? I know it is an old phone, so probably a new one would be better. After all, you are now a high school student. Things are going to change, so let us start with a new phone.”</p>

  <p>I nod as I am getting ready to go to a mall.</p>

  <p>“Th… thanks, mom. Let’s go together,” I said while holding her warm hand.</p>
