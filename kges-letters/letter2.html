  <h1>Quick Snap</h1>

  <p><i>A pretty average vacation day</i>, I think. Here I am, sitting in the car, unsure what to do – sleep? Watch old DVDs? Eat snacks? I’ve done everything.</p>

  <p>Waiting...</p>

  <p>And waiting.. for the front car to move. My only source of entertainment is listening to car horns as my music; it's not like I had a choice anyway. I’m trapped here with my family, who didn’t expect the road to be so full with other “B” license plates.</p>

  <p>It isn’t until I open the car door, that the fresh aroma of trees, rain, and soil strikes my nose. They’re somewhat comforting. The sun shines brighter here. All of a sudden, the long car ride is worth it. At this moment, I just wanted to wander around the place, to run, to be free.</p>

  <p>“Mom, can we please enter the forest? I want to take a walk there and look for monkeys,” I beg my mom with the biggest puppy eyes to let me in.</p>

  <p>"Okay, we can go there, but you have to walk with Oma and Opa okay?” She insists that I walk with my grandparents.</p>

  <p>Well, I guess it's better than nothing, so I nod my head with a big grin on my face.</p>

  <p>It's not like I hate them, but they’re just… slowing me down. </p>

  <p>I reach for my grandparents’ hands, holding them loosely, but they hold mine tightly.
    <br>“Don’t walk too fast, Na,” Grandma reminds me once again to walk slowly.
    <br>One by one, everyone walked past us, as if we’re being left out.</p>

  <p>It's okay, grandparents tend to walk slower.. Right?</p>

  <p>I keep walking with them, but their grip starts to feel like handcuffs, trapping me with them.</p>

  <p>As if it isn’t embarrassing enough to walk at the very back, they decide to keep on stopping at every single photo spot. I never know why someone would need that many pictures of them in Cimory… I wanted to put a stop to this misery, so when the timing was right, I struck.</p>

  <p>“C'mon Na, one more picture and you can go,” Mom says.
    <br>“NOOOO, I’m so tired of taking pictures, just let me go already,” my 4th-grade self can’t do this anymore. 
    <br>“Just one last picture with Opa, and then you can see the monkey over there, it won’t take a long time. Please?” Mom tries to persuade me as if walking with them isn’t embarrassing enough.</p>

  <p>Just then my rebellious side took control. My legs start to run, leaving everyone behind sprinting towards the freedom that I’ve been eyeing for a while.</p>

  <p>But at what cost?</p>

  <p>When I look back, I see it. Their brown eyes squint at me, as their gaze turns weird. Those wordless mouths don’t utter another word. Just a second ago, I thought I had secured my victory. I can feel their disappointed gaze crawling up my skin.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, right now, they’re embarrassed to have a granddaughter like me.</p>

  <p>It felt like time froze, waiting for me to make a move; should I go back to being trapped, or should I keep running for my freedom?</p>

  <p>“Just one more picture with me, please?” Grandpa broke the silence.</p>

  <p>“Okay,” I say, trying not to make a scene.</p>

  <p>My eyes are set on the camera, trying to maintain a similar expression to smiling, by squinting my eyes, showing my messy teeth, and hiding both of my hands.</p>

  <p><i>One.. two.. three.. smile!</i></p>

  <p>“Now you can go,” finally he lets me go.</p>

  <p>It’s a quick snap, but no matter how hard I run, I never outrun the guilt.</p>
