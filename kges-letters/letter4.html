  <h1>11 Tokens & Some Change</h1>
  
  <p>Ama and I stepped into a cacophony of flashing lights and vibrant hues—a sea of neon colors. The arcade buzzed with excitement as teenagers stomped their feet and slapped their palms against the machines.</p>

  <p>I had just turned six the week before, and even I knew the real deal was by the shores—the Teddy Pickers! Each shelter was filled with plush creatures, all stuffed with fluff, typically made in Taiwan. With tokens jangling in my pocket, I swiftly dashed toward them.</p>

  <p>One token for one chance.</p>
  <br>I had eleven.</p>

  <p>The first token clinked into the slot, and the claw came to life. With my legs pushed back and tiptoes that left dents in my sneakers, my hand controlled the joystick. I aimed for the baby-pink piglet that looked all too similar to the one in my kid videos Mom had filmed on her 2000-esque Blackberry. I had sung and danced as if I were a pop star and she was my number one fan. But the piglet wobbled and got away.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry, you can try again!” a mature voice cheered.</p>

  <p>Nine tokens left. I slid in another token, aiming for a tacky-green frog. It looked like the one from Brisbane we ‘accidentally’ killed. In our defense, we were just a group of muddy suburban kids, excited to play on a day when the weather wasn't threatening us with heatstroke. I wonder how many more memories (and murders) we would’ve shared if I had never moved. The frog hopped away too.</p>

  <p>“It’s okay, try another one!” she heartened.</p>

  <p>I dedicated the fourth to sixth token to a blue dolphin. My dad once told me he dreamt of swimming with dolphins. But I couldn’t picture him—balding and all—looking cool in a scene like that. The dolphin slipped, and I wonder if Dad’s dreams had slipped away too.</p>

  <p>Three tokens left. I rescanned the cuddly menagerie, and there he was—a chubby hamster that looked too huggable to resist. I could <i>not</i> let this one go. BUT I HAD THREE TOKENS LEFT. I had three chances. I couldn't mess this up. I just couldn't.</p>

  <p>“Do you want me to win this for you?” Her tone was teasing—but sincere.</p>

  <p>Ama.
  <br>She had been watching me the whole time.</p>

  <p>I had been so mired in my own endeavors that I didn’t even notice she was there, watching me feed token after token into the machine. Her presence, though silent, was present. Less like a race against time, she was there to just enjoy the moment with me.</p>

  <p>“Ama! Yes, please!” I squealed, elated.</p>

  <p>With no delay, she gripped the sweat-slicked controller, maneuvering it with acute focus.</p>

  <p>Third token in,
  <br><i>clink</i>
  <br>nothing.</p>

  <p>Looking at her, I exhaled; the noise of the arcade fading into the background. The claw hovered, and I felt something loose inside me, like I didn’t have to rush or grasp at everything so tightly…</p>

  <p>Second token in,
  <br><i>clink</i>
  <br>nothing.</p>

  <p>…It was enough. Just to be there at that moment. More than enough, actually.</p>

  <p>Then, Ama's elated voice sprang, “We got him!” My pupils followed as the chubby hamster went up and up, his ears flopping as if waving goodbye to the other plushies below.</p>

  <p>Goodbye baby pink piglet, goodbye tacky-green frog, goodbye blue dolphin.</p>

  <p>I still wish all of you could've joined me. I still wish all of you could have stayed. That’s alright, though. Like a beloved stuffed animal, you’ve all left your marks, and that could never mean nothing.</p>

  <p>Ama knew that too.</p>

  <p>"Hey, I've got some change," Ama said, smirking. "Wanna buy some more tokens?"</p>
