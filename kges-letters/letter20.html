  <h1>Green Snake</h1>
  
  <p>Your aunt is a criminal," a noxious sentence that Mom always says to me with the same furious expression when I pocket her food without swallowing it. At first, I brushed it off, but she always repeated the same phrases over and over. It began weighing on me just like the carrot soup she always forced me to eat.</p>

  <p>“What is this all about, Mom?”</p>

  <p>"It's complicated," she replied. "It's her and grandma. Your grandma always takes most of the chicken porridge for your cousins. You will always get the leftovers!"</p>

  <p>I didn’t take it seriously; I was busy with Hot Wheels and solving math problems. Yet, it affected me that I couldn't simply forget this sentence as if it were Thor's hammer. No matter how far it’s thrown, it always comes back.</p>

  <p>A month later, on a usual weekend, Grandma said, “Ben, let’s go find a new game.”</p>

  <p>Eyes wide open, my excitement was palpable. In a flash, I raced to the car with my aunt and grandma, fueled by a euphoria akin to the French celebrating their revolution. I began to spill out every thought from A to Z to everyone inside the car. One letter after another, the atmosphere became increasingly lively and joyful. Until, finally the venomous sentence is revealed. With a triumphant flourish, I boldly and proudly declared this startling revelation to her.</p>

  <p>“Aunty, Mom always said that you are A CRIMINAL!“</p>

  <p>All went hush leaving only the hum of the engine. Everyone exchanged glances as if they had just heard news of the apocalypse. Out of nowhere, that sacred sentence became a striking punchline.</p>

  <p>“Is it true?” Aunt asked while laughing.</p>

  <p>I replied enthusiastically, “Yaaaaa!”</p>

  <p>I bought a new game and made people laugh. I felt like a starboy.</p>

  <p>The star fell off the next day. I wake up to a series of loud bangs rattling the door of my room. Mom opened it to reveal my aunt, with her face flushed red and staring with a sharp gaze at my mother without even once blinking her eye.</p>

  <p>Aunt said, “We need to talk now.”</p>

  <p>Mom quietly followed her to the living room. I’m incredibly curious, but my nanny kept blocking me. Crying was my last resort, so I used it with all the intensity of Goku unleashing his final power.</p>

  <p>Nanny admitted her loss to me. “OK!“</p>

  <p>As the door opened slowly, I heard a cacophony of shouting voices getting louder and louder. The living room suddenly changed to a Soviet interrogation room. There was my aunt berating my mom with a barrage of animal words. Mom sat silently on the red sofa, her head bowed and nobody, not even Dad, stood up for her as if she was as guilty as Ted Bundy. My whole body completely froze, filled with a sense of guilt beyond any measurable scale, not believing that I have changed into a poisonous buzzer.</p>

  <p>Evening came, and she finally returned with a ghostly pallor drained of color. She walked towards me with the vacant stare of a World War II casualty. My entire body trembled, and I couldn’t barely keep my eyes open. But from all of the punches that she could have done, she chose to hug me tightly and whispered, 
  <br>"Ma is very proud of you."</p>

  <p>I could only remain silent, unwilling to break the embrace, hoping that this hug could bring my mom's face its color back.</p>

  <p>Two weeks later, they chose to move out with not even a single apology. They packed their things, while I reflected in a toilet mirror seeing myself as a green snake.</p>
