  <h1>Growing Up, Growing Apart</h1>

  <p>“Why are you busy with your own thing? Didn’t we agree to have a movie night no matter how busy we are?” I yelled at her.</p>
  
  <p>The first thing that came to my mind was <i>here we go again, fighting as usual.</i></p>
  
  <p>Lately, my sister and I have been fighting a lot ever since she got into college. We used to tell each other everything, even the smallest things such as me complaining about the texture of the rice I ate at school or how I screwed up my Math test. However, we started being distant when she became so busy with her university life.</p>
  
  <p>We used to watch movies until 2 AM while giggling and eating some popcorn, but we barely have time to talk to each other nowadays. On top of that, we fight every time we try to talk. I feel like instead of becoming more mature as we grow up, we become more childish.</p>
  
  <p>Every time I tried to tell her my worries that were bothering me, she would always push me away saying she has lots of stuff to do and has no time for me. I always said “okay” and acted cool, as if I was unbothered. However, deep down I missed the old us. I missed those times where we would stay up all night laughing and having deep talks. There were numerous times when I wished I could go back to those times.</p>
  
  <p>It seems as if my wish was granted because that day my sister finished her class early so she asked if we could have a movie night. We haven’t been doing it often even though it has always been our routine every Friday night.</p>
  
  <p>We decided to watch a K-drama called Lovely Runner and ordered some fried chicken because what’s a movie night without it? At first, we were still discussing about the characters but that didn’t last long because my sister soon started to open her laptop and type lots of things.</p>
  
  <p>As the movie kept on playing, I started getting very annoyed when she ignored me and completely stopped watching the movie without even trying to stay focused. I felt so upset that  I was the only one who’s making an effort to spend time together. I couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
  
  <p>“Why are you busy with your own thing? Didn’t we agree to have a movie night no matter how busy we are?” I yelled at her.</p>
  
  <p>“Why are you being so immature? I’m really sorry but this is very urgent. We were supposed to publish our video earlier but something went wrong so I need to edit it ASAP. Just watch without me,” she answered.</p>
  
  <p>“You could’ve told me beforehand instead of wasting my time watching this dumb drama alone. I know you’re busy but I also have lots of assignments I need to complete. Regardless of that, I still spared some time. Can’t you see that you’re being so selfish right now?” I answered and slammed the door.</p>
  
  <p>Am I too sensitive? I thought to myself. It was supposed to be an exciting day, at least for me. However, my sister decided to ruin it. Or was I the only one who ruined our movie night? Was I supposed to be more understanding since she was busy? Was I the only one who’s being selfish? I kept on thinking about my sister’s words.  Am I really that immature?</p>
  
  <p>Now that I think of it, I guess she was right.</p>
  
  <p><i>I'm not mature enough to understand other people’s feelings.</i></p>
