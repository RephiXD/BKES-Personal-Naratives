  <h1>Seven Days</h1>
  
  <p>My favorite cartoon Winnie The Pooh once said, <i>“We didn’t realize we were making memories. We just knew we were having fun.”</i></p>
  
  <p><b>[18:40]</b>
  <br>The word “ACCEPTED” appeared on my phone screen. 
  <br>Acceptance always makes people happy but not for me. I felt horrified.</p>

  <p>One and a half hours before this terrible news, I was having fun with my friends without any bad premonition.</p>

  <p><b>[17:08]</b>
  <br>Painting small statues with different characters while recording a hyper-lapse made my friends and I focus on painting. There was no conversation among us, but we knew we were having fun together. All the noise inside the mall seemed inaudible, so it felt like it was only us inside the mall—just us.</p>

  <p><b>[18:16]</b>
  <br>An hour later, the silence between us turned into laughter. Laughing at each other's work, writing our names in red paint with our index fingers on the table, and teasing each other with the paint left in our hands.</p>

  <p>We posted our work together in our Instagram story with a picture of us taking a mirror selfie, not knowing that it would be the last photo of us hanging out.
  <br>Our last hangout after school in our <i>Pramuka</i> uniform.</p>

  <p><b>[18:40]</b>
  <br>I opened my phone after an hour of not using it. There were three messages from my family’s group chat. I clicked it. My dad sent a file.</p>

  <p><i>A mutation letter? This can't be happening, right?</i></p>

  <p>With my heart racing and thoughts of bad possibilities filling my mind, I clicked the download button.</p>

  <p>I saw my full name written in that letter in bold. My heart dropped.</p>

  <p>“<b>ACCEPTED</b> as students of class XI of Calvin Christian High School for the 2023/2024 academic year.”</p>

  <p>My eyes were wide open, my heart started beating fast and my mind suddenly paused.</p>
  
  <p>What just happened? Is this the end of my happiness? How can I fit into my new school and find new friends?</p>
  
  <p>“Guys... ” I said with my trembling voice and I showed them the letter.</p>

  <p>The sound of laughter became silent. My friends froze in their spots.</p>

  <p>Suddenly my vision slowly became covered with tears. They began to flow down my cheeks as I could no longer hold them.</p>

  <p>I felt a pair of arms hugging me. I cried with my hands full of pink and white paint. A couple minutes later, I heard sobbing sounds coming from my friends. The cheerful atmosphere has turned into sadness.</p>

  <p><i>Why? Why is this happening to me?</i></p>

  <p><b>[19:27]</b>
  <br>I arrived home. I immediately opened the door and rushed to my mom’s room still in my Pramuka uniform and socks.</p>

  <p>I looked into my mom’s eyes in confusion and asked for clarity. My mom said that it was my dad’s decision and it could not be changed because I had been accepted into my soon-to-be new school.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, I felt a vibration from my right hand. It came from my phone. Oh, someone dialed my number. It was my dad.</p>

  <p>I’m sure he called me to explain everything. I pressed the green button on my phone and brought my phone to my right ear.</p>

  <p>My guess was right.</p>

  <p>“This was a synod decision; starting next month, I have to be in Jakarta and you should transfer as soon as possible to adjust to your new school. It would be harder for you to transfer in twelfth grade.”</p>

  <p>I couldn’t resist because he was right. The only thing I could do was accept the situation and enjoy my last seven days with my friends.</p>

  <p><i>Maybe this was the best for me. Right...?</i></p>
