  <h1>Manta Ray</h1>
  
  <p>I stood at the boat’s rim with my snorkeling gear in place, ready to jump. Clouds thickened overhead, casting a dim, somber light over the scene. I felt the wind whipping my hair away from my face, yet sweat trickled down my forehead. My heart raced, unsure if it was an adrenaline rush or fear.</p>
  
  <p>I took a deep breath, trying to distract myself from the turbulent water. I closed my eyes, letting the cool embrace of the ocean swallow me whole. The water tugged me one way, startling me. I tried swimming in the other direction, but the strong current had another plan.</p>

  <p>Then, I saw it—a dark object moving against the current. Despite its vagueness, I was certain it was a manta ray. My dream was finally coming true!</p>

  <p>I’ve always wanted to see the enchanting beauty of a manta ray. In Spanish, the word “manta” directly translates to blanket, which perfectly captures the essence of the gentle sea creature. How can one not fall in love with this giant sea blanket?</p>

  <p>Determined, I fought against the current, pushing myself toward the manta ray. I paddled harder, trying to match its pace, but I barely moved.</p>

  <p>At this point, everything else disappeared. It was just me and the manta ray. The familiar sound of crackling salt in my ears calmed my thumping heart. My slightly stinging eyes locked onto the manta ray, with its majestic wings spread wide, gliding effortlessly through the depths.</p>

  <p>The manta ray’s movements were hypnotic, its black-and-white wings creating a fluid, mesmerizing pattern. Its graceful sweep against the water captivated me, forcing me to ignore the rising waves.</p>

  <p>The further I swam, the harder it became to discern the ray's shape under the ever-darkening water. The shadows started to close in. My breaths grew ragged as I strained to fight the furious current.</p>

  <p>There was no way I could let go of my lifelong dream. This was my chance. I had to catch up, or I’ll forever regret it.</p>

  <p>I thought of removing the one thing restraining me, my life jacket, so that I could dive deeper. But the rough water and violent stream kept my hands stiff. Or maybe it was my gut feeling.</p>

  <p>Before I knew it, I was too late.</p>
  <br>The ray got away.
  <br>No matter what I did, I couldn’t fight the force of nature.</p>

  <p>The manta ray vanished, leaving only the faintest ripple in its wake. I froze. I scanned the dark, empty water, my heart sinking alongside the manta ray.</p>

  <p>I exhaled slowly while floating mindlessly, darkness surrounded me. <i>Is this it?</i></p>

  <p>I pulled my head above the water, turning to where I once came from. My heart dropped once more. I could barely see the boat I jumped from. A chill of realization seeped into my bones. I was too far away. I was all alone. The cold, dark water consumed me. I gulped, tasting the salt that dried my lips.</p>

  <p><i>What do I do now? Do I really have to let go?
  <br>Will I ever get the chance to find another manta ray?</i></p>

  <p>“FWEET!” The sound of a whistle interrupted my thoughts. A ship crew swam in my direction. I could see the panic in his eyes. “Are you okay?” he asked. I nodded.</p>

  <p>“Are you crazy?!” he snapped. I apologized, avoiding eye contact.</p>

  <p>“Everyone’s concerned. They’ve been calling your name, but you wouldn’t respond. You could’ve died out here! Now WE’RE going to die,” he scolded me.</p>

  <p><i>Oh.</i></p>

  <p>"Let's swim back. Everyone's waiting for you."
  <br><i>I guess not every goal is meant to be chased.</i></p>
