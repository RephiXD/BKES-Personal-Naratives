  <h1>Healing in Goodbye</h1>
  <p>I wonder to myself, “if I have no chance to heal from a disease, what would I do?” This question linggered in my mind, especially when someone I love is facing it. So I asked Akong, “Apa yang akong lakukan kalo gak sembuh?”. I grinded my teeth to fight back the tears as I awaited his answer.
<p></p>
    A week later, me and my sister were strolling through the elevator and into my Akong’s room and I blasted through the door like I usually do. But… the first person I witnessed wasn't Akong, it was… Pak Ivan and his gang?!? Yea this wasnt what I expected to see. 
    
    <p></p>“What is happening here?”
    <p></p>
    Confused, I scanned the room, and realized  “He’s finally gonna get baptized? It's about time!” I muttered. As I went into the room Akong was lying sideways, clearly to reduce the pain. Just looking at him makes my anus tinggle as the sensation of pain strikes through my butt, probably because I'm trying to feel how painful the hemorrhoid feels. He was also being massaged by some random person, probably a person who helps sick people because his massaging technique isn't wrong. Man, I'm supposed to be his personal massage therapist " I tried to shrug it off. At least Akong is getting some comfort.
    He turned his head to face me, smiling as always, as he proudly introduced me to that person. “Oh Ini cucu saya, dia jago mijit!” This is already very normal, most old people like to talk about their grandkids. As much as I wanted to spend time with him, I decided to let him cook for today. So I head home to sleep with thoughts on mind:
    <p></p>
        “Yes, he got baptized. But did he want to accept it or was he forced?”
        <br>
        “If he accepts God, does that mean he will be healed?” 
        <br> “If the leukimia cant be healed, God definitely still can heal him!”
        <br> “I'll come back tomorrow to massage him, let him, he deserves it.”
    <p></p>
    
    Except no…, instead of entering dreamland, I jolted awake from the sound of sirens. 
    <p></p>
    My heart dropped.
    <p></p>
    I rushed to the window, looking down while adjusting my eyes and saw.. An ambulance?? My heart stopped. No, no, NO! There's no way! Not so soon!
    <p></p>
    
    Without thinking, I grabbed my phone to call Akong. Ringing, ringing, ringing, “Nomor yang anda tuju se-”, “NAAWWWW” I screamed as I stabbed the end call with the massage hands. I began to shake as I tried to find words that at this point are mixed in my head. But all I can do is pray as I text and recall the past.
    <p></p>
    
    
    
    “Apa yang akong lakukan kalo gak sembuh?” I had asked him two weeks ago.<br>
    “Harus sembuh dongg,” he had replied, always so optimistic, even though he knew. He always tried to make everything seem fine, even when he obviously was dying inside. I guess I inherited that from him. But now, I am terrified. I didn’t have much time left with him, did I?
    <p></p>
    RIIINGGG!! My mom’s call snapped me out of the flashback! “Dimana Akong?? Dia tadi kenapa??” I asked as my voice cant maintain a stable tone. 
    <p></p>
    “Cepetan, kasih tahu apa yang kamu mau kasih tahu Akong dulu, dia gak bisa buka HP,” she shouted worried.
    <p></p>
    I wrote down the unread message that I sent Akong to my mother. Hopefully it still isnt too late. Seconds felt like minutes, and minutes felt like hours. Finally,  his soft and fading reply came through. His final words. 
    <p></p> “Hehe, Josiah pinter”
    <p></p>
    I bit the Gum below my lips as tears rolled to my cheeks. Maby.. this is a better end than being healed. 
    <p></p>
    “Goodbye, Akong”
