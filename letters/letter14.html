  <h1>Self Revolution</h1>
  <p>I always thought that I needed those appreciations to live, but then the immortal light that reflected my soul proved it wrong. 
<p></p>
    The difficult season seemed to fade away my identity, despite the fact it was polishing my self-persistence. Just how I was fighting life and death to delve into the mood of the piece titled, Revolutionary Etude. It’s a piece that was inspired by the Battle of Warsaw in 1831, with a sense of fiery and emotional conflict between the war of Poland and Russia. That time, I was in preparation for a piano competition in Hong Kong. Through the process, I hardly found myself in the character of the piece and I no longer recognized myself who breathed through melody. Tears were countless and hand injury colored the process of turning hatred into love. In the depths of my emotions, I discovered the true colors that made me shine.
    <p></p>
    Since I was young, music has been my therapy and second language. Just fingers dancing on black and white keys, driving me into another world of imagination that is unreal. Music reflected a ray of sunshine for the soul, followed by the spirit dance unfolding. As I began to develop my passion for music, I started joining numerous competitions that enriched my music journey. But this time was different, a solemn dream was winded by the dark ages. The harmony was suddenly covered by the dissonance of the soldiers march.
    <p></p>
    The war lasted for days and months. Six hours in the air and finally landed on the island that I’ve longed for, Hongkong. Million dreams followed my step as the eye of a tiger.
    <p></p>
    The day has finally come where I had my real battle. Last minute, I could feel myself in a battlefield surrounded by numerous competitive enemies. My mind was filled with a scene of bloody war that locked me in the fuss with my heart skipping a beat, sunk in the waves of intensity. I walked with doubt, but that didn’t bury my confidence. 
    <p></p>
    During four minutes of battle, I got myself on the stage and spoke out through every single keys that represented my vigor and spirit.   
    <p></p>
    Then, came the moment that I’ve been waiting for, no other than the moment of truth. The room was suddenly frozen, but the heat of expectations was rising. My heart tick…tock… following the rhythm of the winner announcement.
    <p></p>
    5th…<br>
    4th…<br>
    3rd…<br>
    2nd…<br>
    Is this my time?
    <p></p>
    My heart skipped a beat as the presenter called a name! A name that shut doors of hope. 
    <p></p>
        “I beneran gak dapet apa-apa, ma?,” I asked my mom hopelessly.
        <p></p>
    As they were celebrating their trophy, I stayed still in my position questioning reality.  Petals blossoming started to wither. My ego started boiling, and as I stepped out of the room I bursted into tears. The cause of my sadness was not the fact that I lost the competition, but that I lost for the second time with the same piece that I played before.  I lost the war for the second time, is this a sign for a third war?
    <p></p>
    “Losing is not everything, as winning is not everything”, said my teacher.
    <p></p>
    I left home with bountiful expectations and full of confidence, yet I returned empty handed and my pride was swallowed under the soil. 
    <p></p>
    The rain damaged my wings, so I rested. I won’t define that rest as an end, but a self revolution. Failure is what I dealt with but making my capabilities and trust for myself as an enemy is what was dying me away.
