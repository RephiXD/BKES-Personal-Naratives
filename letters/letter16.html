  <h1>When Goodbye Comes</h1>
  <p>It was 6:30 a.m. as I woke up in my patient room. My eyes began to scan all over the room, the walls seemed spotless, the white coloured tiles and even the couch looked pale. Everything seemed perfect, just as it should be, but still, something felt off. Then, a sudden thought came through my mind, “What if Pea were here right now?” as I imagined what it would be with its presence. Allowing myself to make a scenario if it is sitting besides me right now, accompany me in this suffocating room by its whiteness.
<p></p>
    Then, a sudden ringing sound flashes through my ears. Recognizing where the sound came from, I hesitated, dread filling my chest as I saw my aunt’s name. Her voice trembled on the other side. “Pea is getting worse,” she said, and my world crumbled. The once-spacious hospital room suddenly felt suffocating. I couldn’t breathe.
    <p></p>
    My heart sank, weighed down by the news, as if a heavy blanket had been placed over me. I could feel the sterile hospital room closing in on me, getting smaller and tighter with every breath. The air around me felt like it was getting thinner.
    <p></p>
    Pea wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my companion through every hardship. His playful hops and gentle nudges had filled our home with warmth. Whenever I cried, he always seemed to sense it, coming to my side with his soft nudges, offering comfort in his own way. Now, he was suffering, and there was nothing I could do. My aunt couldn’t decide whether to take him to the vet or not, fearing it would only prolong his pain. She didn’t want him to suffer, but the thought of losing him was unbearable.
    <p></p>
    I wasn’t there to comfort him, to hold him in his final moments. All I could do was wait, feeling helpless. Time passed in agonizing slowness. Every hour felt like a weight on my shoulders. My mind was torn between the desire to hold on and the knowledge that it was time to say goodbye. When the doctors finally entered my hospital room, telling me I was ready to go home, my first thought was of Pea.
    <p></p>
    I came home and rushed to Pea’s side. He lay still, his tiny body trembling, his breathing shallow. The vibrant, joyful creature I once knew was fading before my eyes. I picked him up, cradling him gently in my arms, whispering how much I loved him. He looked at me, almost as if he understood, but his eyes were half-closed. And then, he screamed a sharp, heart-wrenching sound that cut through the room like a knife.
    <p></p>
    He shuddered once more and then… nothing. The silence was unbearable. Tears streamed  down my face as I held his lifeless body close, my heart shattered. In the days that followed, the house felt empty. Every corner reminded me of him, the places he used to hop, the spots where he’d curl up and rest. The grief was overwhelming, but slowly, I found solace in the memories we shared.
    <p></p>
    Pea was gone, but he was no longer in pain. He had brought so much love into my life, and though the loss was profound, I knew we had done the right thing by letting him go. His spirit would always be with me, in my heart, forever.
