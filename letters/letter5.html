  <h1>THE DAY BEFORE</h1>
  <p>
    My phone rang once, and my brother’s name showed up. Confused as to why he’s calling me during church,  I declined it immediately. It rang again, this time my father’s name showed up. I declined it once more, but I was no longer confused. I felt the sudden adrenaline rushing through my body, igniting each of my nerves, and making my heart pumped way faster than it was. I hurried to check the family group chat, praying to God that my assumption was wrong. It wasn’t. 
<br><p></p>
    Saturday morning, the day before. <br>
    We were already inside the car 2 hours before the party started. The air felt thickened when my mom told me that we needed to go to my grandparents’ house first. I swallowed back my disagreement, because of course I love meeting my grandparents. A few minutes passed and I was finally able to see the vintage looking house, with a front yard full of turf that needed to be cut, and a recently polished orange gate. 
    <br><p></p>
    I went straight to my grandparent’s room to greet them, so I could leave as fast as I could. There was only my grandma, sitting on her bed while facing the wall. “Halo opung!” I said loud enough for her to hear. She didn’t turn around to see me nor greeted me back. Huh, weird. 
    <br><p></p>
    When my mom’s voice already reached the room, it was my cue to go outside and wait for her to finish her grownup talk. I grabbed my cousin’s scooter and rode it across the living room to kill the boredom. 
    <br><p></p>
    It was already my 19th turn and my mom hadn’t finished her talk with my grandma. The clock kept ticking and my friend’s birthday party was getting closer and closer. I went to check what they were doing and saw a rather confusing scenery. There was no talking. My grandma was still looking at the wall and she didn’t move a bit from her position when I greeted her. Mom was holding grandma’s hand tightly and she looked worried sick when the nanny said grandma had been sitting there since 6 am. 
    <br><p></p>
    A few questions came out of my mom’s mouth but my grandma didn’t answer any of them. “Udahlah ma, ayo kita pergi nanti jadi telat.” My mom ignored me and continued to try to get grandma to talk. She kept failing and wasting time. I was already driven up the wall so I raised my voice when I hurried my mom to leave the third time. “MAH, AYOLAH, ngapain sih buang-buang waktu?!” 
    <br><p></p>
    We finally stepped out of my grandma’s room, when I saw a glimpse of her, still sitting in the same position. 
    <br><p></p>
    Not a lot of minutes passed and my mom dropped me off. I stepped up the stairs with my flowy dress, half running, and ready to meet my friends. I searched through the place but could only find one of them. Confusion fills my thoughts and turns out, we were the only ones that had arrived. I felt a little guilt for throwing a tantrum over nothing, but who cares? When the others had arrived, we began to take cute pictures, make silly videos, eat cake, just a regular fun birthday party.  
    <br><p></p>

    <br><p></p>
    Little did I know, the tiny guilt I felt yesterday was about to be one of my most unforgettable guilt in less than 8 hours. 
    <br><p></p>
    I left the church and immediately saw my brother and sister. They reached me with an expression that I have never seen before, and without any thoughts, the three of us hugged. “Opung udah gaada, De,” said one of them and we immediately sobbed together. 
    <br><p></p>
    We were then inside the car ready to go to the hospital to see my Grandma. The car ride to see my Grandma, very similar to what I did yesterday, but with such different feelings. This car ride was filled with grief, regrets, and guilt.
