  <h1>When Words Finally Spoke</h1>

  <p>
    It was a quiet Saturday, I hadn’t gone to school for a year. I stretched out lazily on my bed, feeling the familiar hum of my room. My world had shrunk to these four-sided walls, with the glowing games filling the emptiness inside. The outside felt distant, and honestly, I preferred it this way — no expectations, no burden, just me living in pixels.
  </p>

  <p>
    That afternoon, the soft creak of the floorboards signaled someone was coming — my mom.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hi,” she began, “What are you doing? Are you busy?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “No, why?” I muttered. My voice was barely audible while my eyes were still glued to the screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hey!,” her voice rose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took a deep breath and reluctantly set my phone down.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What?” I snapped. I didn’t mean to sound so harsh, but the frustration bubbled as I hadn’t finished my game.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to find comfort in her voice before. She was always there — whether there was big stuff or just me rambling. But lately, I’d rather answer with quick mumblings or even let it hang in the air while she’d linger in the doorway as if waiting for me to say something more.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’ve noticed you play games a lot lately,” she continued. Her voice raised slightly, “We’ve discussed this before and you chose to continue your music, but it feels like you’re losing focus.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I knew it was a big deal back then and my parents had paid a lot for this. Her words stung more than I cared to admit. I lashed out before I could stop myself, raising my voice in a way I’d never done before.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I do practice, Mom!” I yelled. It was a lie. I knew it. Admitting the truth felt like conceding defeat, which was too bitter to swallow. My body trembled a lot, knowing I’d done something wrong. I couldn’t go back in time. It was too late.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mom’s eyes widened in shock. For a moment, the room was quiet. She’d never seen me this angry, and neither had I. Her face hardened. She grabbed the cloth hanger rack beside her and slammed it to the floor swiftly. The sound echoed through the house. It was broken as the bits of iron scattered across the floor. In that instant, the anger in her eyes was replaced by something else — hurt.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, it’s up to you then,” she left my room, leaving me stunned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next morning, Sunday sunlight streamed through my window as I sat in my room, trying to focus on the online service. My mind, however, was far from the sermon. Yesterday’s incidents weighed on me until I couldn’t turn my head to see my mom’s face.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the service, I locked my door. The anger and guilt swirled inside me. Hours passed as I tried to distract myself with games. It was 3 pm when I heard a knock. I opened it slowly. It was my mom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her eyes were red and swollen from crying. She stood there momentarily and then said, “I’m sorry.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Her voice trembled and cracked as tears began to fall.
  </p>

  <p>
    She stepped closer, pulling me into a tight embrace. “I didn’t mean to hurt you, I love you,” she whispered. I felt my tears start to flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was the first time I’d ever heard her say those words. At that moment, I knew my pride and anger had ruled over me. I hugged her back and said, “I’m sorry, Mom. I love you too.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The distance I’d felt from my mom melted away and the bond had returned.
