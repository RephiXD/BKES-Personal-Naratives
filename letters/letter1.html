  <h1>Unplanned Secretary Life</h1>

  <p>
    ‘Life is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived.’  
    — M. Scott Peck

  <p>
    Kring... Kring... The school bell rang, signaling that school for this Monday was over.  
    “Siap! Beri salam!” said the 11.2 class leader firmly.  
    “Selamat siang dan terima kasih, Bu Yoosy,” all 11.2 citizens said enthusiastically because they wanted to get out of Biology class quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I slipped my white biology ring book into my black bag. I slung it over my shoulder and headed out of the BIOKIM class toward the student council room while remembering what my Pak Boss (a nickname for the student council president) said when changing classes from PAK to SejInd class at today's 10:45 AM.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hai, Jel! Jangan lupa pulsek rapat ya,” said Juan, my Pak Boss with Juan's characteristic tired voice that would appear after Sejin class.  
    “Hmm... Yaaaa”, I responded with a loud voice and a smile because I’m in a jubilant mood of seeing my friends from other classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I was walking in the hallway between BIOKIM and Cafeteria, I walked against the flow of students who were walking to the elevator to go home. Yes, that was my life as student council secretary 23/24. Always full week of meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and meetings. Today's agenda is an internal meeting for 1 hour and a monthly meeting with Mr. Anthony in the Principal's room from 4 PM until finish which lasts 1 hour, more or less.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, I remembered one memory from my kindergarten days. While my classmates were outgoing and boisterous, I was a shrinking violet and silent child. I rarely spoke up in class, and the teachers didn't even know my name. In fact, until I was in elementary school, I was often looked down upon by my peers until I felt that my future would always be the same as I would be looked down upon. Some people think that I will always be the same as a shrinking violet and silent child. I’ve been labeled as a passive kid even with people that are close to me and I know that from how they treat me. They assumed that my passivity would never be resolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Life, however, had other plans. Now, I'm not that passive girl anymore. God changed my life, He gave me potential in my life, He changed me from a passive little girl to an expressive girl that can use her potential and contribute to others. I now serve as the secretary of the student council, where I play a vital role in designing and organizing essential files for big events. Moreover, I was able to organize the internal documents of the student council so that my student council could have a neat track record. I find great joy and fulfillment in this work. Also, it is a form that I am grateful for the One and only Person who gave me change in my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the meeting with Mr. Anthony, as usual, I put on my light blue jacket and savored the sunset sky while sighing with all the day's activities. Isn’t life unpredictable? (chuckle at the absurdity). How is it that a shrinking violet and silent child can now become a secretary of a student council that I or anyone else would never have thought of? Life was a mystery.
