    Kring... Kring... The school bell rang, signaling the end of classes for Monday.  
    “Siap! Beri salam!” said the 11.2 class leader firmly.  
    “Selamat siang dan terima kasih, Bu Yoosy,” all students in 11.2 replied enthusiastically — eager to finally leave Biology class behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    I slipped my white biology ring book into my black bag, slung it over my shoulder, and headed toward the student council room. As I walked, I remembered what my Pak Boss (our nickname for the student council president) had told me during our class break at 10:45 AM:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hai, Jel! Jangan lupa pulsek rapat ya,” Juan said with his signature tired voice after SejInd class.  
    “Hmm... Yaaaa,” I responded loudly and cheerfully, still caught up in the joy of seeing friends from other classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    While walking through the hallway between BIOKIM and the Cafeteria, I moved against the stream of students heading home. Yes, that’s life as the student council secretary — always rushing from one meeting to another. Today’s agenda included an internal meeting followed by a monthly discussion with Mr. Anthony in the Principal’s office, both lasting about an hour each.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, I remembered a memory from kindergarten. While my classmates were outgoing and boisterous, I was quiet and shy. I rarely spoke in class, and sometimes teachers didn’t even know my name. Throughout elementary school, I was often overlooked or looked down upon — until I started believing that I’d always be treated that way. People close to me assumed my passivity would never change.
  </p>

  <p>
    But life had other plans. God changed me — from a passive little girl into someone expressive and capable of contributing meaningfully. He gave me potential, and now I serve as the secretary of the student council. I help design and organize essential files for big events, manage internal documents, and ensure everything runs smoothly. This role brings me great joy and fulfillment.
  </p>

  <p>
    More importantly, I’m grateful for the One who made this transformation possible. Without Him, I wouldn't have found the courage to grow beyond the labels others placed on me.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the meeting with Mr. Anthony, I put on my light blue jacket and stepped outside. The sky glowed with the colors of sunset. I took a deep breath, letting the day’s activities settle in.  
    Isn’t life unpredictable? (I chuckled at the absurdity.) Who would’ve thought that a once-shy child could become a student council secretary — a role no one, not even myself, ever imagined for me?
  </p>

  <p>
    Life truly is a mystery.
