  <h1>Stitching Magic Through Chaos</h1>

  <p>
    In the distance, Cinderella Castle seemed to shimmer more than usual, the light reflecting off my glassy, tear-filled eyes, creating the illusion that the castle sparkled enchantingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    But it wasn’t tears of joy, it wasn’t just wonder. I was trying to blink away the frustration and rage building up inside of me. There I was, crying in the happiest place on earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The smell of freshly baked churros and popcorns fills the air, blending with the laughter and excitement of the kids. Balloons of every color shaped like Mickey bob in the air.
  </p>

  <p>
    The day was perfect, filled with thrilling roller coaster rides, taking pictures with all of the princesses, and I did it all with my beloved cousin. But the best part has to be taking a picture with my favorite Disney character, Stitch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The blue alien dog captured my heart when it popped out on my TV one random afternoon. His chaotic antics made me laugh and I just couldn’t resist his adorable ears and big eyes. Despite being a troublemaker, I adore how he found a place amongst humans. Ever since then, Stitch has been my favorite — a little chaotic, but full of heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    My parents, knowing how enthusiastic I am about the character, bought me a tiny one with magnets on its paws so it could cling onto anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    I showed it off to my cousin and it backfired.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Let me borrow it, please, please, please. I won’t lose it, I promise.” She begged, the pitchy and constant noise was as grating as a persistent mosquito.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Fine, fine… just shut up.”
  </p>

  <p>
    She eagerly wrapped the Stitch around her backpack. She promised she won’t lose it. She lost it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can see my family members panicking and scattering around to retrieve my little blue buddy.
  </p>

  <p>
    My frustration bubbled up, and before I knew it I shoved her. “You promised!” She shoved me harder and I fell to the ground. The impact of the fall stung bitterly, not on the butt I fell on, but in the core of my chest. Maybe it’s because I’m brawling with the person who is dear to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mother hurried over to break us apart. Her intervention was quick and decisive.
  </p>

  <p>
    My face is stained with tears, trying to suppress the anger I had let out. My face also flushed red due to the guilt and embarrassment of my impulsively brutal action.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can’t comprehend what I did. I zoned out, my mother’s scolding felt like a distant echo. I stared blankly at the horizon, where Cinderella’s castle stood tall. The magical atmosphere felt dimmed, like the colors had drained around us.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I found the doll!” my father’s sharp voice pierced through the haze.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took the doll from him. Somehow, the doll felt heavier in my hand, probably because of the guilt weighing it down.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’m sorry.” Unable to look her in the eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Me too.”
  </p>

  <p>
    We didn’t hug or make any gesture of reconciliation. I loosened the grip on Stitch and let out a deep breath, feeling the heaviness slowly lift.
  </p>

  <p>
    The walk to the castle was slow and quiet. Now glowing in the evening light, the castle seemed to shimmer with renewed magic, as if patiently waiting for me to embrace it again.
  </p>

  <p>
    As fireworks burst above, painting the sky with shimmering colors, I glanced at my cousin. The tension between us lingered, but it had softened.
  </p>

  <p>
    She nudged me lightly and I nudged her back, a smile breaking through. No words needed, just a quiet understanding that spoke volumes.
