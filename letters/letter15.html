  <h1>2,000 Rupiah</h1>
  <p>Lately, my relationship with my dad feels distant like there are some unspoken stands between us. I never want to be hugged or kissed anymore. Even to make eye contact while talking. 
<p></p>
    As time passes, people grow and change, both externally and internally. 
    <p></p>
    But, I once had such a close bond with him. 
    <p></p>
    Once, I shared laughter with him. Once, we shared everything, literally every single thing. He showed me how to kick, just in case I got kidnapped. After his shower, I would always comb his hair. I used to hug him every night before bed. He did the Eskimo kiss to my nose every night.  I used to run to him whenever I cried. Once, we joked and played together. He would lift me high, and in his arms, I felt like I was about to touch the clouds. 
    <p></p>
    But I wanted the higher one. I wanted to ride a cable car! I wanted to look at the clouds closely!
    <p></p>
    In TMII, he offered me a cable car ride. Of course, that was what I had been waiting for! It was ten years ago.
    <p></p>
    At the counter, the officer asked if he wanted to return to the station or just one way. I immediately asked for a round-trip, thinking it would be more fun, without knowing the extra cost.
    <p></p>
    After the cable car ride, he held me and brought me to a fast food restaurant near the cable car station. 
    <p></p>
    “Satu paha bawah sama nasi. Berapa?” As the cashier mentioned the price, she took the golden-brown drumstick and rice onto a tray. He took out several bills of different colours. 
    <p></p>
    But, he was 2,000 rupiah short. 
    <p></p>
    The movement of his fingers went through space after space inside the wallet, over and over again with his wallet's mouth opened widely as if to show off its emptiness. His firm eyebrows were furrowed. His mouth was tighter and thinner as he bit into it. His face was not like when he taught me how to cook rice or told me not to sleep late. 
    <p></p>
    He was panicked. 
    <p></p>
    He took out 200 rupiah, “Bisa bayar pakai ini dulu? Saya gak tahu uangnya gak cukup.” 
    <p></p>
    
    The crowd noise all around numbed my hearing. 
    <p></p>
    A wave of guilt washed over me. I wondered if it would be better for me not to eat or if I should offer to do the dishes. As I monologuing, the cashier grabbed the coin roughly from my dad’s hand. She shot us a sharp look, and it gave me a feeling of being judged. 
    <p></p>
    I noticed how quickly self-esteem could be undermined by something as straightforward as a cash register's judgment, our worth to a balance of coins. I hate her.
    <p></p>
    I lost my appetite although the chicken looked crunchy and smelled savoury. The chicken turned bitter on my tongue. Because of me, my father did not eat. Because of me, we were treated unfavourably by the cashier. 
    <p></p>
    “Papi, aaaaaaaa.” I offered a bite of my meal but he insisted he was full. I knew he was lying. My father continued to rummage through his wallet, hoping to find a piece of 2000 tucked away. 
    <p></p>
    The world was on my father's side, there was a 2,000 rupiah note, folded into a tiny square in his wallet. He headed towards the cashier in a hurry, smiling with relief. A smile I never saw again.
    <p></p>
    When 2,000 rupiahs felt so valuable, I realised my father's love was priceless. It was not about the currency; it was about dad’s love.
