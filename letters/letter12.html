  <h1>Welcome Back, Dad !</h1>
  <p>“Inget! Kalau ada yang lagi kerja, ikutan bantuin ya! Jangan leha-leha” was what my Dad told me ever since I was little. He has always been a hero to me; the pinnacle of a gentleman. He always helped my mom every morning, greeted me with a hug and gave the warmest smile, every single time. I hung onto my father’s word, day after day after day, until that one fateful morning.
<p></p>
    I remember that day, the bed was super comfortable. The natural sleeping music of the rain and the breeze of freezing air set the stage for a very pleasant sleep. I would have slept, if not for the loud footsteps banging on the floor, rushing towards my room. 
    <p></p>
    “John!! Mama lagi bikin acar! Kamu jangan malah tidur-tiduran ya! Bantuin sono!” 
    <p></p>
    My sense of responsibility kicked in, I still need to work. It took a handful of willpower to get me up. My body ached left and right, and the first thing I saw shocked the hell out of me. It’s my dad watching TV getting his foot up the couch, smiling, laughing, seemingly enjoying the show. My mind goes EXCUSE ME??? I thought he was busy working as well, but he was leasuring all by himself. 
    <p></p>
    In my head I was furious yet so confused, how could Dad do such things??? I didn’t know a dad like this. The dad I knew was true to his word. He is the one who taught me to not enjoy myself when others work. How can he do such atrocious things? Too many angry thoughts clouded my mind, and I didn't realize the pool of blood all over the cutting board, I had just cut my finger. 
    <p></p>
    Red; my blood, my brain, my heart all filled with red. My fingers didn’t hurt anymore, my heart yearns for an answer. I need a reason, why did my dad do that, why??  
    <p></p>
    “John udah ya… papa tu capek… kamu masih muda, papa mau istirahat, biarin aja…  nanti kalo kamu udah gede kamu juga sadar kok…“ My mom answered. 
    <p></p>
    “Tapi mah!! Aturan itu aturan masa papa mentang mentang kepala keluarga maen seenak jidat nggak lakuin!!!”
    <p></p>
    My wail and my demeanor made it clear that I cared only for the violated rules. My mom gave in and I was left no answers, no valid reasons at all. 
    <p></p>
    The burden and the rage in my heart hasn’t faded. But, it has become a very busy week. School assignments piled, my thighs ached from biking my way home, and eyebags started forming, a very very black one. 
    <p></p>
    That Wednesday, I went home really late. I opened my front door and warmness came out of the house, an old man greeted me by the door. Wrinkles filled his face and he had a little hunchback. This face, isn’t this my dad? My dad is a fragile old man now? 
    <p></p>
    I felt like God punched me in the face. This is what Dad feels everyday? Mentally and physically drained by working 8-5, driving 2 hours home and he’s 53 years old?? Moreover he was taking on that large burden of work for me… and, I didn’t even think and appreciate his condition. 
    <p></p>
    I never said sorry or even changed my demeanor in front of him, my ego is too big to be shattered, but I have grown to appreciate my dad’s “laziness”.
    <p></p>
    He is a great man, but whenever he turned abnormally lazy, I always thought: 
    <p></p>
    Huh, he is a human after all, caught him some slack, he is exhausted from working for…
    <p></p>
    me.
