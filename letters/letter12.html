  <h1>Welcome Back, Dad!</h1>

  <p>
    “Inget! Kalau ada yang lagi kerja, ikutan bantuin ya! Jangan leha-leha” — my dad told me this ever since I was little. He has always been a hero to me; the pinnacle of a gentleman. He helped my mom every morning, greeted me with a hug, and gave the warmest smile every single time. I clung to my father’s words day after day, until that one fateful morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember that day. The bed was super comfortable, the rain played its natural lullaby, and the cold breeze made it even cozier. I would have slept peacefully if not for the loud footsteps rushing toward my room:
  </p>

  <p>
    “John!! Mama lagi bikin acar! Kamu jangan malah tidur-tiduran ya! Bantuin sono!”
  </p>

  <p>
    My sense of responsibility kicked in — I still needed to work. It took all my willpower to get up. My body ached everywhere, and the first thing I saw shocked me completely. There was my dad, watching TV with his feet up on the couch, smiling and laughing at the show. My mind screamed: EXCUSE ME??? I thought he was busy working too, but instead, he was relaxing all by himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my head, I was furious yet deeply confused. How could Dad do such a thing? I didn’t know a dad like this. The dad I knew lived by his own rules. He was the one who taught me never to enjoy myself while others were working. Why was he breaking his own principles now?
  </p>

  <p>
    So many angry thoughts clouded my mind that I didn’t even notice the blood on the cutting board — I had cut my finger. But strangely, my finger didn’t hurt anymore. My heart only yearned for an answer. Why did my dad do that? Why?
  </p>

  <p>
    “John udah ya… papa tu capek… kamu masih muda, papa mau istirahat, biarin aja… nanti kalo kamu udah gede kamu juga sadar kok…” my mom answered softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Tapi mah!! Aturan itu aturan masa papa mentang-mentang kepala keluarga main seenak jidat nggak lakuin!!!”
  </p>

  <p>
    My wail and my demeanor made it clear that I cared only about the broken rule. My mom gave in, and I was left with no answers, no valid reasons at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The burden and rage in my heart didn’t fade easily. But life got busy — school assignments piled up, my thighs ached from biking home every day, and dark eyebags started forming under my eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    That Wednesday, I came home really late. As I opened the front door, warmth welcomed me from inside. An old man greeted me by the door — full of wrinkles, slightly hunched over. Was this really my dad?
  </p>

  <p>
    I felt like God punched me in the face. This is what Dad feels like every day? Mentally and physically drained from working 8–5, driving two hours home, and he’s already 53 years old?? And all this time, he was carrying that huge burden for me…
  </p>

  <p>
    I never said sorry or changed my behavior in front of him. My ego was too strong to break. But I’ve grown to appreciate my dad’s “laziness.”
  </p>

  <p>
    He is a great man. And now, whenever he turns unusually lazy, I always think:
  </p>

  <p>
    Huh, he is a human after all. Caught him slacking. He’s exhausted from working for…  
    <strong>me.</strong>
