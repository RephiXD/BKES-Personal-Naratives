  <h1>Welcome Back, Dad!</h1>

  <p>
    “Inget! Kalau ada yang lagi kerja, ikutan bantuin ya! Jangan leha-leha” was what my Dad told me ever since I was little. He has always been a hero to me; the pinnacle of a gentleman. He always helped my mom every morning, greeted me with a hug, and gave the warmest smile, every single time. I hung onto my father’s word, day after day after day, until that one fateful morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember that day. The bed was super comfortable, the natural sleeping music of the rain and the breeze of freezing air set the stage for a very pleasant sleep. I would have slept peacefully if not for the loud footsteps banging on the floor, rushing toward my room.
  </p>

  <p>
    “John!! Mama lagi bikin acar! Kamu jangan malah tidur-tiduran ya! Bantuin sono!”
  </p>

  <p>
    My sense of responsibility kicked in — I still need to work. It took a handful of willpower to get me up. My body ached left and right, and the first thing I saw shocked the hell out of me. There was my dad watching TV with his feet up on the couch, smiling, laughing, seemingly enjoying the show. My mind screamed: EXCUSE ME??? I thought he was busy working too, but instead, he was relaxing all by himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my head, I was furious yet so confused. How could Dad do such things? I didn’t know a dad like this. The dad I knew lived by his own rules. He was the one who taught me never to enjoy myself when others were working. Why was he breaking his own principles now?
  </p>

  <p>
    Too many angry thoughts clouded my mind, and I didn't realize the pool of blood all over the cutting board — I had just cut my finger. Red; my blood, my brain, my heart all filled with red. My fingers didn’t hurt anymore, my heart yearned for an answer. I need a reason, why did my dad do that, why??
  </p>

  <p>
    “John udah ya… papa tu capek… kamu masih muda, papa mau istirahat, biarin aja… nanti kalo kamu udah gede kamu juga sadar kok…” My mom answered softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Tapi mah!! Aturan itu aturan masa papa mentang mentang kepala keluarga maen seenak jidat nggak lakuin!!!”
  </p>

  <p>
    My wail and my demeanor made it clear that I cared only about the violated rules. My mom gave in, and I was left with no answers, no valid reasons at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The burden and the rage in my heart haven’t faded. But it has become a very busy week. School assignments piled up, my thighs ached from biking home, and eyebags started forming — very dark ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    That Wednesday, I went home really late. I opened the front door and warmth came out of the house. An old man greeted me by the door — wrinkles filled his face and he had a little hunchback. This face… isn’t this my dad? My dad is a fragile old man now?
  </p>

  <p>
    I felt like God punched me in the face. This is what Dad feels every day? Mentally and physically drained by working 8–5, driving two hours home, and he’s 53 years old?? Moreover, he was taking on that large burden of work for me… and I didn’t even think or appreciate his condition.
  </p>

  <p>
    I never said sorry or changed my demeanor in front of him. My ego was too big to be shattered. But I’ve grown to appreciate my dad’s “laziness.”
  </p>

  <p>
    He is a great man. And whenever he turned abnormally lazy, I always thought:
  </p>

  <p>
    Huh, he is a human after all. I need to give him some slack, as he's exhausted from working for…  
    <strong>me.</strong>
