  <h1>SUPER Glue</h1>

  <p>
    I wanted to be with them for 1 week, 1 month, even 1 year!! I don’t want to lose them all when we’re no longer together again. I want to spend my time with them for the last time. Even though at first I hated school, now I want to rewind time and start over my journey. I regret not cherishing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    It all started at the end of the holiday before becoming a 12th grader. My heart is pounding so fast when I see the announcement about GLUE. I thought I would be with one of my friends, but NO! When I saw the group, I had so many thoughts. I’m not close with any of them — how am I supposed to enjoy this event?? Am I going to be alone in this group? Who should I be close to?! The hollow sound of my deepest mind keeps bugging me, the time came and got closer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Day 1 is when we start to get closer by sticking together as a group. I didn't expect much since I don’t close with them. Even though I think that they're not the type of fun people, they're way fun. I can see when we play games, it feels like childhood again. I know that I won’t be able to feel this way again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Day 2 is when everyone waits for it and bonds with their groups. We bonded very well at every game and tried to win it. And the time has finally come when every group shows their talent. We take a look at every group. And you know what? My group is at the end of the talent show. My heart is pounding fast, it feels like it might give out. But it turns out so well — everyone’s laughing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Day 3 is our last day together. Our last game together was to protect the candle from water, but our black shirts didn’t get wet much. Short story — at the end of our last day together, we took a photo. This GLUE makes me feel like I have a family. My group of friends in GLUE is lovely. If you want to know who it is, it was Ruben, Angel, Timsit, Togi, Heidi, Refaya, Matthew C., Stephany, Tyrone, Gloria, and Matthew P. We were very bonded at this moment — we did everything together. I love them all. If I didn’t meet them, would I enjoy this GLUE?
  </p>

  <p>
    When we return to our places, we stay in contact by swapping our Instagram usernames and telling each other our impressions and hopes when we’re not together. I write about them in my white book. I write about how grateful I was when I met and bonded with them.
  </p>

    That day I read my journal from 10th grade. As I watch and read every word carefully, I just think, “Jo, lu keren banget, you survived until now.” I’m starting to reflect on myself — I was like, “Gila ternyata gw berubah banget dari kelas 10 ya.” I also found my true self in high school. I’m feeling a bit more mature than myself in 10th grade. I was very proud of myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    But it’s not just that — and you know what? I’m starting to have hopes again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now I’m almost at the end of my chapter in high school. I didn’t think that time would fly away so fast. Even in my last chapter I still found friends from the 10th grade. I will be sad if I leave them and graduate. Will I meet people like them again?
