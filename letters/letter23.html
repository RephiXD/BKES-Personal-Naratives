  <h1>365 Days</h1>
  <p>I could smell a dozen teddy bear bouquets waiting to be presented. “Wisuda angkatan XIII” was scribbled all over the vinyl wall. I could hear echoes of snifflings. I could sense a hall full of pride as parents watched their children walk on that stage. It's graduation day! The mark of a new beginning. It should have been a joyous occasion, right? So why did my heart feel like it was about to burst?" It wasn't even my graduation and all my senses were screaming.
<p></p>
    That day began like any other Friday. 7. a.m starts class as usual, then I rushed home the moment my phone clock struck 3 p.m. I got ready in my most proper and casual attire. The ceremony starts at 4. p.m, and as usual, I was late.
    <p></p>
    Like most graduations, this one started with the principal’s opening speech greeting all guests and reminding the graduates of their bright future ahead. It was continued by a guest speaker, usually one of the graduate’s parents highlighting their kid’s journey throughout high school. 
    <p></p>
    I could swear it was just yesterday that I attended last year’s graduation, and there I was attending my upper grader’s. I sat next to proud parents in the massive auditorium on the 8th floor gazing up at the large screen, witnessing as graduates walked up the stage to receive their diplomas and shaking hands with the principal. At that moment, I realized how fast a year went by between these graduations,  and it was officially 365 days till mine.
    <p></p>
    Anxiety crept in and I found myself involuntarily eavesdropping. “Iya, aku keterima di UI,” said one of the graduates. Another chimed in “Wah, congrats ya! Kalau aku sama temen-temen aku keterima di Prasmul”. They went on comparing future universities and concocting hang-out plans.
    <p></p>
    Immediately,  ruminative thoughts forced their way into my mind. “I'm going to be alone abroad aren't I?” High school can feel like hell at times, at least I have my peers to suffer through it with. The idea of facing life alone is unfathomable.
    <p></p>
    Watching the graduates engage in gleeful conversation one last time before they officially became alumni forced me to walk down memory lane. 
    <p></p>
    Pretty soon I know I need to bid farewell to the two stalled canteens with repetitive menus everyone fights over during breaks. Strangely, I’ll miss the food wars conducted by the irritating middle schoolers. Between the five of us in our friend group, it's always going to be two “katsu moza”, one “ayam cabe garam”, one home-cooked meal, and one catering. Life truly won’t be the same without being in a clamorous cafeteria, sitting face to face with them as we interrupt our lunch by indulging in scandalous rumors and staring cynically at our target. High school was made tolerable by them.
    <p></p>
    “It will be our graduation soon” I could no longer deny.
    <br>“But I don't want to be alone” my heart battles my brain.
    <br>“365 days” I muttered.
    <p></p>
    The erupted applause marked the end of the ceremony and the beginning of the 365-day countdown.
    <p></p>
    365 days to participate in adolescent gossip, 365 days to complain about reflection tasks, 365 days to argue with teachers over tests, 365 days of sleep deprivation, 365 days to create memories I'm going to look back on with a wistful smile, and 365 surround myself with familiar faces. 
    <p></p>
    In a few months, I’ll be back in that same hall, with the same teachers and sensing the same pride, but it’ll be “Wisuda angkatan XIV” scribbled on the wall instead. Maybe by then, I’ll be ready.
