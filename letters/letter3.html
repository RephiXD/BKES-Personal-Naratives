  <h1>Crushing the Wall</h1>

  <p>
    My footsteps raced across the floor, keeping pace with the collective pounding of hurried steps. When my tiny hand nudged the wooden brown door, a lofty wide ceiling was captured. My inner self was tuned to align with the hectic and sweating atmosphere as my feet stepped into an artistic room. I immediately dropped my bag, grabbed my old plastic file, and plugged the keyboard cable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, the crowded noise and shuffling footsteps around me faded. My ear immediately recognized the rhythmic, familiar sound of footsteps. As a pair of black shoes approached, I caught a glimpse of them from the corner of my eye. Without needing to look any closer, I knew it was HIM.
  </p>

  <p>
    As my face turned away from him, I was immediately disturbed by what my friend said yesterday:  
    “Dia mau ngomong sesuatu sama lu.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Literally?! After a year? What in the world did he want to say?
  </p>

  <p>
    I pretended to be busy, denying the fact that my first crush was my best friend.  
    I remembered knowing him for the first time and feeling a burst of excitement. The comfort of our new friendship was like a warm blanket. With each interaction, our connection deepened, and we seemed to sync perfectly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Countless stories had woven together the fabric of our experiences. Minutes turned into hours, and gradually, little laughter turned into waves of smiles from my heart. Then, an electrifying spark surged, making my heart flutter with excitement.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is this strange feeling?  
    Is this the feeling of having a crush on someone?  
    There is no way I like him, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    When I realized the odd emotion, I tried to act indifferent, denying it with all my strength until it became a heavy burden. The weight of my thoughts felt too great to keep contained, and eventually, my feelings began to overflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has been a year since that day—the day I decided to pour out my feelings. Maybe if I told him, I would be relieved and slowly this odd feeling would vanish. It turned out it was all just "maybe."
  </p>

  <p>
    Just two words:  
    “Thank you.”  
    His confirmation words were unspoken. The hope to get rid of the feeling failed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even new emotions were being updated: confusion, guilt, self-blame. A boundary wall seemed to grow between us. The comfort mood transformed into awkwardness in every interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same five words reigned non-stop in my mind:  
    “Have I ruined our friendship?”
  </p>

  <p>
    As I noticed my inner self grumbling, I kept calming down my soul. I waited, waited, and waited. But nothing. He was busy with his world—playing a freaky game.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dejected. Tired. Indeed, it was hopeless. I should stop waiting. I kept myself busy like a bee. That thought slowly moved away from the center of my mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    When all of us were gathered outside, chatting while eating some snacks, a familiar and uncertain gesture walked toward me.  
    “Bisa masuk ke dalem bentar ga?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I wonder what he wants to say” was what I thought as my nervous footsteps followed him, entering the same giant wooden door.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the midst of a thick atmosphere, two pairs of tense eyes looked at each other while our trembling voices and rushing heartbeats filled the air. With each word coming out of our mouths, the boundary wall between us slowly crashed down. A sense of vulnerability triggered us to reconcile and preserve our friendship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unconsciously, tears streamed down my cheeks as I realized: since the day those pair of black shoes approached, I was ready to hang our friendship onto its lifeline.
