  <h1>Tears At Party Time</h1>
  <p>
    At her sweet 17th party, I see her dad doing the opening of the party as the master of ceremonies. Something I wished for, but never got. The thoughts of my dad doing that is something that I can't imagine because that is impossible. The difference between her dad and my dad is insane though I only see a little bit of her dad, I can tell what her dad is like. I can't move my eyes away from her dad though he already moves and is no more at the center of attention. My mind filled with…
<p></p>
“Oh, how sweet he was to her. I really wish dad was like that, but dad is …..”
<p></p>
Then as time goes on, while at the party, everyone that wears white to brownish color stands up moving around to take photos with the party girls and chat or play with each other. I was…
<p></p>
“Please don't cry, act normal, don't let any tears be visible to anyone here, especially here in her sweet 17th party, it's supposed to be fun and happy times.”
<p></p>
Trapped in a lifeless body, salty water drowning and stings my eyes trying to become tears. My mind or soul floating in a void returned to the first time I cried about this “mom why dad is not like my friend's dad?” Then to the story about the past that explains why my parents are like this now. The first time hearing is just understanding but empty like asleep and not dreaming, but when remembering it again with more knowledge, my heart is crushing myself, my mind putting weight on my soul more and more, it's soul crushing.
<p></p>
It's happening again. The feeling of breaking down or heart broken everytime I see someone else's dad being sweet and then I remember things about my dad. I just can't control it, I don't like it, but it happens everytime, it seems like I have to accept that. My mom says to not be sad or think about that but I can't get over it. 
<p></p>
My friend asks why I'm just sitting and quiet. I try to cover up with “I usually am like this”, he says ok. Then when it's dinner time it's like normal hotel stuff. At my table a group of boys ask me if they can sit with me and I say yes. I thought I already calmed myself but no, everytime I'm not alone or talk even a bit after calming down from almost crying. The feeling of crying slapped me in the face. I want to discuss or just to tell others about my condition for comfort or something, but I can't because it's a secret that only my family can know. It's like a heavy weight that my soul though weak but has to carry. I hate that I can't just complain about it to someone else openly. I'm a way to honest person so usually I can't keep a secret, but dad is the only secret that I will always and have always kept from everyone else that doesn't know it yet.
<p></p>
When I return to the car after the party and see my dad. I remember once I wrote about having a dad like my dad is not always a negative thing…,  I'm still grateful that I have my dad, I love him forever, I pray for God's kindness on dad every night.
