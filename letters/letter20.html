  <h1>A Journey to Two Wheels</h1>
  <p>A Journey to Two Wheels 

    One Saturday, it was just a normal day, I woke up without anything to do, feeling like I would just be lazing around the house that day, but oh boy was I wrong. I hear my parents footsteps approaching my room. 
    
    How do we get here? Let’s go back a little. 
    
    Since I was small, about five to six years old, I already could ride a bike. My eyes were shining and there was a big smile on my face when I rode my bike, but here is the problem, it was a four wheel bike, and no one would ride a four wheeler when they are eleven years old right? Or I thought so.
    
    I have seen my brother ride a two wheel bike, but I always walk off on the idea of changing to a two wheel bike. “I was comfortable with my four wheel bike”, that's what I said because I never want to think about the idea of changing to a two wheeled bike. “How can I control a two wheeled bike? What will happen if I fall?” So many thoughts in my mind when I am thinking about riding a two wheeled bike. 
    
    That Saturday my parents came to me and asked “Do you have anything you need to do today?” they ask. 
    I said no since I am clueless of what their plans are.
    
    “Great, let's learn to ride a two wheeled bike then. We think it's about time.”
    I was shocked, I was stunned and frooze. “How did it come to this? I should have say I have something to do." I said to myself as I started to regret what I said.
    
    “Come on now, change your clothes and we are ready to go!” said my parents.
    
    I changed my clothes powerlessly while trembling and we went to a big park to have a wide space for me to learn how to ride a two wheeled bike. 
    
    My dad took my bike from the car and removed two small wheels from my bike quickly. We travel around the big park to find a perfect place to learn how to ride a two wheeled bike and found it. 
    
    “Come on, try to ride it,” said my parents.
    It all came down to these, I was not ready for this. My hands was shaking. I was trembling, my hair stood on the end as I was looking at the bike. I was still asking question I used to ask. There was this mixed feeling I feel like I was hopping around and going into the dark sea at the same time. 
    
    I took baby steps onto my bike. I carefully held onto the bike and hesitantly got onto the bike. I carefully started pedaling and paused, until I kinda got the hang of it and I started pedaling the bike around. I thought I had finally mastered the two wheel bike, until all of sudden I lost control and fell. I was about to give up, but my parents were not. They asked me to try again.
