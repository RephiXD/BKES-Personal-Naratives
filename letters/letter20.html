  <h1>A Journey to Two Wheels</h1>

  <p>
    One Saturday morning started like any other — I woke up with no plans, expecting to spend the day lazily at home. But oh boy, was I wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    I heard my parents’ footsteps approaching my room. That’s how it all began.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let me rewind a bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I was around five or six years old, I could already ride a bike. My eyes would light up, and a big smile would spread across my face every time I got on it. But there was one thing different — mine had four wheels. At eleven years old, riding a four-wheeler felt embarrassing. Everyone else had moved on to two wheels, but I hadn’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had seen my brother ride a two-wheeled bike, but I always avoided the idea of switching. “I was comfortable with my four-wheel bike,” I’d say. Truthfully, I never wanted to think about changing. How could I control a two-wheeled bike? What if I fell? So many fears ran through my mind whenever I considered it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then came that Saturday. My parents walked in and asked, “Do you have anything to do today?”  
    I said no, not knowing what they were planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Great, let’s learn to ride a two-wheeled bike then. We think it’s about time.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I was shocked. Stunned. Frozen.  
    “How did it come to this? I should’ve said I had something to do,” I thought to myself, already regretting my answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Come on now, change your clothes and we’re ready to go!” they said cheerfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    Powerless and trembling, I changed my clothes. We headed to a large park with plenty of open space for learning. My dad took my bike out of the car and quickly removed the training wheels. We wandered around the park until we found the perfect spot.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Come on, try to ride it,” they encouraged.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was it. I wasn’t ready. My hands shook. My body trembled. Even my hair seemed to stand on end as I looked at the bike. It was a mix of emotions — excitement, fear, and uncertainty — like hopping into a dark sea with no idea what awaited beneath.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took baby steps toward the bike, carefully climbed on, and hesitantly started pedaling. After a few shaky moments, I felt like I was getting the hang of it. I even managed to ride around a little.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just when I thought I had mastered it, I suddenly lost control — and fell.
  </p>

  <p>
    I almost gave up, but my parents didn’t let me. They told me to try again.
