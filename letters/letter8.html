  <h1>The Imperfect Doll</h1>
  <p>The moon shone gracefully with sullen light. But that calmness contradicted within me. My heart pounded furiously in my chest as if it were about to burst, and each beat echoed louder amidst the silence in my room. My palms, slick with sweat, left dark, damp patches on the fabric of my gray sweatpants. My breathing got shallower as if it didn't want to be caught. I couldn't quit fidgeting with my fingers until one started bleeding.
   <p></p> The last thing I felt was excitement as I realized that tomorrow was the dreaded graduation day. I was assigned to serve numerous roles, as accompanist, speaker, and singer. I nodded to all the offers, not realizing how harried and tense I would become.
    <p></p>My grades were also another thing to worry about. Despite my best efforts, my results often fell below my expectations. I need to make my parents proud, I would tell myself, even as a small voice whispered that I might not achieve the desired results.
    As I stood alone in the quiet room, staring at a blank white page that was supposed to be filled with my speech script, I felt a tremendous weight on my shoulders and murmured to myself, I would never be good enough. Displeasing thoughts strangled me, not allowing me to breathe.
    <p></p>
        What if I messed up and everyone would laugh at me?
        <br>What if I did something wrong and ruined the whole party?
       <br> What if I disappoint my parents?
    <p></p>
    These what-if thoughts left me feeling on edge. The weight of perfection always rested heavily on my shoulders. The idea of failing and not meeting everyone’s expectations agitated me, casting shadows over every step my foot went through. 
    <p></p>I was so used to being seen as the good smart girl, although I doubted those qualities in myself. The obligation to uphold that image burdened me, shrinking my shoulders slowly. I needed to be what everyone else thought of me, even though I knew deep down that I was anything but. Letting my genuine self be seen by others was a nightmare for me. Hence, I put on the "perfection" mask to be liked and noticed. 
   <p></p> Unable to calm myself, I decided to confide in my homeroom teacher as the moon’s cold light revealed haunting shadows. As I poured out my thoughts, she listened carefully. Her occasional nods and empathetic expressions encouraged me. When I finally finished speaking, she offered me a warm, reassuring smile before she began to respond.
   <p></p> She finally leaned forward, her eyes filled with understanding. She started telling me a story about her old friend, Lily. Lily was a doll gifted by her late father. Lily was perfect, as my teacher described, “She was dressed in a vibrant shade of pink, garnished with tiny bits of white polka dots. Her hair was neatly braided with matching ribbons.” 
   <p></p> But now everything about Lily is the opposite. “Her once-bright dress is now faded. Her button eyes dangle by a thread. Her once-fresh look is now filthy. Yet despite her flaws, or perhaps because of them, Lily was irreplaceable.” my teacher continued. 
   <p></p> Her final words struck me with the realization that all this time, I had been chasing the illusion of love as perfection when in truth, love is the beauty of acceptance.
   <p></p> Her words wrapped around me like a warm blanket, relieving my strain. Tears traced a path down my cheeks, but not from grief. Droplets of them stained my gray sweatpants as I tucked myself into my bed. The moon's luminous peace blanketed the night, granting a quiet assurance.
