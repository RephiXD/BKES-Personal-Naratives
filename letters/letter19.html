  <h1>Chasing Unspoken Dreams in the Shadow of Expectations</h1>
  <p>I sat up straight in the chemistry class, which had been going on for 30 minutes, my eyes filled with light as I watched Mrs. Sintia's captivating presentation about acid base concept. Seeing her explain so gently and clearly made me think, “can I be like her?”
<p></p>
    Have you ever seen those short video clips of teachers or professors going about their daily teaching lives on social media? Have you ever thought, "I wish I had a teacher like that?" Or maybe even, "I want to be an amazing teacher like them?”
    <p></p>
    For the past 2 years, I have often wondered what kind of future I want to live, apart from the happiness that everyone else is pursuing. Doctor? Pharmacist? Pianist? Fashion designer? Of course, I have had many dreams since I was young, but as I have grown older, I began to see evidence that the world is very complex, like trying to solve a puzzle.
    <p></p>
    Since my feet stepped into my living room, I felt a cold air surrounding my body when I was greeted by my grandma’s gaze, a gaze that was not the same as usual. What happened while I was at school? Is there something bothering grandma?
    <p></p>
    “So, what major do you want to take in college?”
    <p></p>
    Oh my God, that question again. I'm starting to get sick of hearing that question which will eventually lead to hours of debate. 
    <p></p>
    I lay down on the sofa in front of my grandma trying to gather the energy to answer her question. I’m the eldest grandchild in my large family that carries thousands of hopes as high as the seventh heaven. It is very difficult to make decisions without the intervention of my own family.
    <p></p>
    “No, grandma doesn’t agree if you study in Indonesia. Grandma wants you to study medicine in Taiwan!”
    <p></p>
    My  bright smile faded when I saw my grandma’s unpleasant expression. The atmosphere in the living room shifted drastically, becoming awkward and tense after I explained the many reasons why I wanted to study in Indonesia. All this time, she had never once mentioned wanting me to study abroad.
    <p></p>
    My heart felt like it was stabbed by hundreds of stabs just because of two sentences from my grandma. What about my life goal plan that I have designed in such a way? About majoring in education or Indonesian literature and then teaching at SMAK Calvin while writing my dream novel to be published. I just want to live in Indonesia and have healthy relationships with my work life, is it that hard to agree to my life plan? 
    <p></p>
    “Being teachers is useless, their salary is so small, there is no experience and money. If you become a teacher, what do you want to live for? At least you should take foreign language literature so that you have the opportunity to apply for a job at a big company. Grandma regrets putting you in SKC!”
    <p></p>
    My body went limp after hearing all the sharp words that came out of her mouth. I can't imagine how all my dreams will disappear like bubbles blown away by the wind. As I sat in silence, surrounded by the weight of my grandmother's words, I realized something. Maybe the world wouldn't always agree with my choices, and maybe the path ahead wouldn’t be easy. But deep inside, I knew that the dreams I carry are mine, and no one else can live them for me. If I don’t fight for them, who will?
