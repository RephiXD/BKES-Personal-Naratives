  <h1>Standing in Front of the Court</h1>
  <p>“C'mon guys! Kita bisa menang ini. Jangan takut buat berani masuk, jangan takut ke block. Kalau gagal, ga rugi, langsung balik defend!” That was what the coach said to us in the middle of the game. 
   <p></p> I had started my day with a shiver down my spine and feet that couldn’t stop moving. I have a basketball tournament this evening. I couldn’t stop thinking about what would happen in court later. 
   <p></p> I started to remember last year how I spent a lot of time improving my basketball skills. I went to the court, just to throw the basketball for 3 hours in 5 days in a week. From being unable to do anything to being able to do what the coach asked. I’ve been through a rollercoaster of emotions, both happy and sad. I’ve gone through many defeats and pains, both physical and mental. I’ve been waiting for this tournament for a long time. Will it be enough for me to win?
   <p></p>The school bell finally rang “KRINGG…KRINGG…” I was in a daze and a notification came out on my phone. It was from the basketball group. I left the class and sauntered down the stairs each step one by one. It was so crowded, I couldn't even hear my friend’s voice. I started to observe people around us. I started to notice my opponents, “Are those people my opponents later?” We discussed it for a while and we gathered in a tent. We hug each other forming a circle and pray. After a long time, it was time for us to go to the court. Rowdy sounds can be heard from the side court. My whole body froze because of the cold and the nervous feeling. The floor was very slippery, it felt like I could even ice skate there. After what felt like a year, the game started. 
   <p></p>
   <p></p> We started the game with good gameplay. But the opponent’s team also gave a good resistance and tried to fight us back. We took turns exchanging points continuously. My body started losing power, but I had to hold the exhausted feeling. I didn’t care about the result, all I thought was I had to keep playing until my last breath. The match was so intense that the supporters were so loud that it made my ears buzz. When it changed to the third and fourth quarter, my team started to fall apart. We made a lot of blunders and were losing points continuously until experiencing a far comparison with the opponent. Our coach started to encourage us because he believed that we could win. 
   <p></p> After the transition, we felt optimistic again. We played like we would win and gained each point one by one. I couldn't even feel my feet and my pain, I kept running and running, chasing the ball wherever it went. Rushing out my opponents was what I wanted and needed the most at that time. It turns out that our efforts were still not enough to win. Even though we played better and we managed to chase our opponent’s points, of course they didn't let us win easily so they tried to fight us back. 
   <p></p> In the end, the time was up and we lost 2 points against the opponents. It’s all over. I felt devastated there and couldn't keep my head up. Also I felt so mad at myself and wanted to stop playing basketball. But even so the next day after school, I kept going back to the court and throwing basketball again and again.
