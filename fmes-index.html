  <h1>FMES' Personal Naratives</h1>
  <p>Every single person—past, present, or future—without exception, is shaped by their own past experiences. As such, they all have their own stories to tell, stories that are completely unique to them. Of these stories, there are those which changed a person’s entire world—a world-bending originality.</p>
  <p>Here, my classmates and I have written our own stories. Just one story from just one moment in our 17 years of living. A moment that we believe changed the course of our lives. A moment where we gave up on something, had a fight with a friend or family, felt we’d lost something important, found something meaningful, or learned a lesson we would never forget.</p>
  <p>Despite being at most 18 at the time, we laid bare our weaknesses in our writing. I can personally attest to the amount of courage it takes to do this. We shared our drafts with each other and learned firsthand what it felt like to be vulnerable. We felt the fear of being judged, the fear that we were all alone, that no one would understand us. But we also learned how to genuinely connect with another person– the reward for taking that first step.</p>
  <p>I ask you to keep that in mind for every story you read through. They are not simple stories, but parts of our very being poured into writing.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,
  <br>Aaron Subroto</p>
