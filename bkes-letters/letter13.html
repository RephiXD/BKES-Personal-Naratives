  <h1>Healing in Goodbye</h1>

  <p>
    I wonder to myself, “If I have no chance to heal from a disease, what would I do?” This question lingered in my mind, especially when someone I love is facing it. So I asked Akong, “Apa yang akong lakukan kalo gak sembuh?”. I gritted my teeth to fight back the tears as I awaited his answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    A week later, my sister and I were strolling through the elevator and into my Akong’s room and I blasted through the door like I usually do. But… the first person I witnessed wasn't Akong, it was… Pak Ivan and his gang?!? Yea this wasn't what I expected to see.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What is happening here?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Confused, I scanned the room, and realized — “He’s finally gonna get baptized? It's about time!” I muttered. As I went into the room, Akong was lying sideways, clearly to reduce the pain. Just looking at him makes my anus tingle as the sensation of pain strikes through my butt — probably because I'm trying to feel how painful the hemorrhoid feels. He was also being massaged by some random person, probably a person who helps sick people because his massaging technique isn’t wrong. Man, I’m supposed to be his personal massage therapist. I tried to shrug it off. At least Akong is getting some comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned his head to face me, smiling as always, as he proudly introduced me to that person. “Oh Ini cucu saya, dia jago mijit!” This is already very normal — most old people like to talk about their grandkids. As much as I wanted to spend time with him, I decided to let him rest for today. So I head home to sleep with thoughts on my mind:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, he got baptized. But did he want to accept it or was he forced?”  
    <br>“If he accepts God, does that mean he will be healed?”  
    <br>“If the leukemia can’t be healed, God definitely still can heal him!”  
    <br>“I'll come back tomorrow to massage him. Let him rest. He deserves it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Except no… instead of entering dreamland, I jolted awake from the sound of sirens.
  </p>

  <p>
    My heart dropped.
  </p>

  <p>
    I rushed to the window, looking down while adjusting my eyes and saw... an ambulance?? My heart stopped. No, no, NO! There's no way! Not so soon!
  </p>

  <p>
    Without thinking, I grabbed my phone to call Akong. Ringing, ringing, ringing… “Nomor yang anda tuju se-”  
    “NAAWWWW!” I screamed as I stabbed the end call with these massage hands. I began to shake as I tried to find words — but they were all mixed up in my head. All I could do was pray as I texted and recalled the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Apa yang akong lakukan kalo gak sembuh?” I had asked him two weeks ago.  
    “Harus sembuh dong,” he had replied — always so optimistic, even though he knew. He always tried to make everything seem fine, even when he obviously was dying inside. I guess I inherited that from him. But now, I am terrified. I didn’t have much time left with him, did I?
  </p>

  <p>
    RIIINGGG!! My mom’s call snapped me out of the flashback!  
    “Dimana Akong?? Dia tadi kenapa??” I asked as my voice couldn’t maintain a stable tone.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Cepetan, kasih tahu apa yang kamu mau kasih tahu Akong dulu, dia gak bisa buka HP,” she shouted, worried.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wrote down the unread message that I sent Akong to my mother. Hopefully, it still wasn’t too late. Seconds felt like minutes, and minutes felt like hours. Finally, his soft and fading reply came through — his final words:  
    “Hehe, Josiah pinter.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I bit the gum below my lips as tears rolled down my cheeks. Maybe… this is a better end than being healed.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Goodbye, Akong.”
