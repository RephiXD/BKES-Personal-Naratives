  <h1>Cracks in the Armor</h1>

  <p>
    My dad doesn’t cry. My dad’s the type who fixes my broken shelf back together in one night. He’s the type who keeps his emotions tightly locked, but spits out an occasional cuss. My dad has always been the epitome of physical and emotional toughness. A man’s man, as people like to say.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, being tough doesn’t mean he’s emotionless. He surprises me with a pig-themed phone case just because it looks silly. He tells me to have a good day and night, but he never cries. My dad might laugh, shout, or worry — but he never cries. So when I witnessed him weeping that night, it was as if everything I had known about him flipped upside down. There was a part of my dad that I never knew.
  </p>

  <p>
    It happened when my sister complained of having severe stomach aches. I don’t remember much, but I do remember he couldn’t sleep at night. Even though he didn’t have any aches, it was like he carried her suffering with him.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some checks, it turned out she had an infection. No surgery was needed, just some changes to her eating schedule. Everything seemed under control, yet a heavy silence spoke loudly in the room. Dad sat in a daze, listening to the words coming out, lost in thoughts as he drove home.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he arrived home, he went straight to my room.  
    <br>“How’s everything?” I asked.  
    <br>It was a simple question, but something shifted in him when I asked. The doctor’s words finally broke through his thoughts. I could feel a sudden wave of sadness coming. Tears poured from his eyes, one after another, like a flood that’d been held back for so long. His breaths heaved with sobs. He couldn’t seem to regain control. He couldn’t do anything but cry, and I couldn’t do anything except stare blankly at him.
  </p>

  <p>
    In all the years we’d lived under the same roof, that was the first moment I’d seen my dad cry.  
    <br>I caught a flicker of his vulnerable heart, slipping away through the cracks in the armor.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I stared at him break down, my heart broke too. I’d always seen him as unshakable, but now he was just… human. Vulnerable. Fragile. I cried too, but not for the same reasons my dad did. My tears came from helplessness. My dad, who’d always been tough, was now broken — and I couldn’t help. I desperately wanted to reach out, but I was paralyzed by fear and uncertainty. Should I reassure him, or would my words only add to his pain? I stood there, feeling like an unwelcome intruder in his vulnerable moment. Unable to speak, unable to comfort. Trapped in a haunting realization — that I was helpless to save him. That thought cut deeper than any wound I’d ever known.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I still don’t get it. I keep asking myself. Her condition wasn’t life-threatening. Even the doctor confirmed it. Then why? Was it fear? Guilt? Tons of questions swirled in my mind, but I couldn’t find a single answer. I wasn’t sure if I should ask or just let it be. In the end, I did nothing. I stayed quiet, afraid that bringing it up might make things worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    To this day, I still don’t know why he cried. We never talked about it — not then, and not since. It’s like those tears were something neither of us dared to lift. Perhaps it was too painful for him to explain, or perhaps he didn’t have the words. Or maybe it was something deeper — something about being a parent that I might never fully understand.
