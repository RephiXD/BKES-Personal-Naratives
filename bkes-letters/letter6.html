  <h1>Tears At Party Time</h1>

  <p>
    At her sweet 17th party, I see her dad doing the opening of the party as the master of ceremonies. Something I wished for, but never got. The thought of my dad doing that is something I can't even imagine—it's impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The difference between her dad and mine feels insane. Even though I only saw a little bit of her dad, I could already tell what kind of person he was. I couldn't move my eyes away from him, even after he stepped aside and was no longer the center of attention. My mind filled with thoughts:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh, how sweet he was to her. I really wish dad was like that, but dad is...”
  </p>

  <p>
    As time went on, everyone wearing white to brownish colors stood up, moving around to take photos with the birthday girl, chat, or play with each other. I sat still, silently telling myself:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Please don't cry. Act normal. Don't let any tears be visible to anyone here—especially not at her sweet 17th party. It’s supposed to be fun and happy times.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Trapped in a lifeless body, salty water stung my eyes, threatening to fall. My mind—or my soul—floated in a void, returning to the first time I cried about this. “Mom, why is dad not like my friend's dad?” Then came the story from the past—the reason my parents are the way they are now. The first time I heard it, I understood, but felt empty, like I was asleep and not dreaming. But remembering it again with more knowledge crushed my heart. My mind kept piling weight onto my soul. It was soul-crushing.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was happening again—the feeling of breaking down every time I saw someone else’s dad being sweet. Each time, memories of my own dad flooded back, and I couldn’t control it. I didn’t want it to happen, but it always did. My mom tells me not to be sad or think about it, but I can’t just get over it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A friend asked why I was sitting quietly. I tried to cover it up by saying, “I usually am like this.” He said okay. When dinner came, everything seemed normal—like any hotel event. At my table, a group of boys asked if they could sit with me, and I said yes. I thought I had calmed myself, but I hadn’t. Every time I’m not alone or talk a bit after calming down, the urge to cry slaps me in the face.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to discuss it, to find comfort by sharing—but I couldn’t. This is a secret only my family knows. It feels like a heavy weight my fragile soul has to carry. I hate that I can’t openly complain about it to anyone else. I'm usually an honest person who struggles to keep secrets, but my dad’s situation is one I’ve always kept hidden from the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I returned to the car after the party and saw my dad, I remembered once writing that having a dad like mine isn’t always negative. I’m still grateful I have him. I love him forever. And every night, I pray for God’s kindness on him.
