  <h1>Holding the Knife</h1>

  <p>
    Her eyes were glossy. My features resembled hers so much that it was as if I was looking into a mirror. I saw her wrinkles deepen — this time not from a scowl but a frown. She was trying not to cry. Not in front of me, at least. She always tried to appear strong to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Did it mean I was stronger because I had made her cry? Was I tough for provoking her tears?
  </p>

  <p>
    “Anjing, lah!” I spat just a minute before. I hadn’t directed it toward her, hadn’t used the word to refer to her. At least that was what I told myself — because it was easier than admitting that I was a foul human being.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stormed out of the kitchen before I could see her tears falling. I shut myself in my room. I slammed the door out of panic and the floor joined my twitching fingers for a moment. The posters all over my wall looked dull. The bed that I once thought was the most comfortable place on earth felt no different than concrete.
  </p>

  <p>
    I pretended that she wasn’t starting to weep, that I had imagined the gloss in her eyes. Then I found that still couldn’t convince myself that I hadn’t hurt her with all those lies.
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked myself when I had become so mindless with my words, so self-centered, so hostile. I asked myself when I started to weaponize them — to use them like a knife that I gripped in my hand at all times, always pointed toward people that I love.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was such a long time ago that I couldn’t remember. It was as if I was always holding that knife.
  </p>

  <p>
    Always holding the knife. Always.
  </p>

  <p>
    Always? Then I remembered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Someone once put the knife in my hand. I was no more than ten years old.
  </p>

  <p>
    The house was old and smelled of wood. She was in the kitchen. It was only natural until we started yelling at each other. She emerged from the stuffy room holding a knife — the same knife that sliced the carrots in my soup and the tomatoes in my omelette.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were face to face. I could see the pores on her red face, the bumps from hours of steam exposure, staring at me as if her eyes weren’t piercing enough. I saw sweat dripping down her forehead before her grip on my hand tightened. I was now holding a knife. She pointed the end toward her stomach. I saw its end inching against her shirt.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Tusuk. Tusuk, Bea. Kalau kau benci aku, tusuk.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Hot tears streamed down my cheeks. My heart was trembling no less than my hands. My intestines were in knots. My yells turned into screams of frustration. I didn’t want to hurt her. I tried turning the knife toward my own — but she was much stronger than I was. Her skin burnt against mine as she kept my fingers around the steel handle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seven years later, that same knife was still in my kitchen drawer. I never touched it again unless I had to — but the knife that was my words was still attached to my hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was only once that I was forced into holding something like it. It was long overdue for me to choose to put it down.
