  <h1>Warm Memories, Cold Goodbyes</h1>

  <p>
    My body remains fixed in a position, sweat running down my face and my hand trembling as I reach for a used ice cream container. I pulled the lid off and saw a happy face there, with her hand reaching for something — the figure that I always longed to see for the last 2 years — lying right side up, stiff and cold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything seemed normal this afternoon. Our school bus just parked in front of the school building after a long trip and I was just trying to catch up with the messages I got the whole day until a notification caught my attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hoshi… cek freezer sebelum membusuk. Kalo udah langsung kubur aja.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Huh?
    <br>
    Hearing that, my body starts to move on its own. Before I fully understood what was happening, I found myself reaching for grab on my phone and ordering a ride home all while my eyes made a river.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mind just wandered off.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You, the one on the left, shall be called Mochi”
    <br>
    In a brown box, I found two small figures — not larger than a small potato. The one on the left, Mochi, had white snowy fur and petite ears. Her white face looks innocent and peaceful, she has a black spot right over her right eye that gives me a glimpse of Cruella.
  </p>

  <p>
    She liked to stuff her cheeks with everything, even if it didn’t fit. I scanned the dining table, trying to find something I could give to her. Anything would do, from a random block of tofu, a grain of rice, or a bite from my drumstick. She’ll take everything I gave her and put it in her cheeks. It always looks cute. Her two tiny hands, grabbing things, just like humans. She’ll bring all of her food to the food corner which is where she would unload her cheeks and eat.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know for how long my mind wandered off, but it sure was long enough to get me to my front gate. I say thanks to the driver and then walk slowly towards my house, bringing enough courage to open the gate. I took off my shoes, threw my bag to the floor, and ran towards the kitchen where the fridge was. A cold shiver runs down my spine.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hesitated, unable to muster the courage to open the door.
  </p>

  <p>
    I recall the night when I couldn't sleep. Mochi was always there as my sweet little company. I put my hand in her box and she took a lot of small steps to climb it. We’ll spend our night together on my bed, Mochi with her night walk and me just staring at her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some other times, when she feels silly, I don’t even need to pick her up. She can climb her box alone, to my bed, and try to scare me by biting my toes. It’s not just my toes apparently, but also my bedsheet — she bites all of the corners of my bedsheet and now it has a lot of holes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why do I remember all of this? Will all of this be just a memory?
  </p>

  <p>
    I finally get myself to hold her cold body, tears falling from my eyes like warm rain as I try to bring back her warmth. Which I know will never bring her back.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know what to do, she'll be in a paper box, sailing down the river by the end of the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leaving me with her memory, her food corner, and her chewed patch on my bed sheets.
