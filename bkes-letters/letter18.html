  <h1>Rest in Peace, Dear Amah</h1>

  <p>
    I stood alone in the midst of a hallway, trying to strengthen myself by holding back the tears that drenched my cheeks. As if I knew what would happen if I opened the door ahead. I chose to step back slowly to cover up this inevitable sadness. All my struggles tempted me to keep wondering: “What’s happening beyond these doors? Is Amah getting better?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier that day, a message popped up on my phone’s notification.
    <br>“Hai guys, I want to remind y’all that today we have rehearsal around 5 P.M at the Urban Studio,” said my dance captain.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Again? Oh no... Should I skip the rehearsal just because I need to take care of Amah? What should I do?” I whispered. However, I felt bad if I didn't join the dance rehearsal after being in the hospital for a few days, then I decided to go without my dad’s permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    After 8 hours, as the rehearsal started, I tried to concentrate. The music echoed through the room and I moved instinctively, letting the rhythm guide me. Yet, with each turn, leap, and spin, my thoughts kept wandering about her frail body lying in that hospital bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Halfway through, I pushed myself harder, trying to drown out the nagging voice in my head. Sweat began to pour down and my legs grew heavier with each movement. Still, I refused to let my emotions spill over. Not here. Not now.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of rehearsal, I felt both physically and emotionally drained. My teammates congratulated each other on a job well done, but all I could think about was rushing back to the hospital. My phone vibrated. I hesitated, fearing the worst, but when I looked, it was a message from my dad.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Where have you been? Don’t you see that your grandma still in the hospital?!” snapped my dad.
  </p>

  <p>
    Panic surged through me. I hurriedly packed all my stuff lying on the floor and headed straight to the hospital.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the middle of the street, I was flooded with memories of Amah. I remembered how my parents used to tell me that when I was little, I spent hours at Amah’s house while they worked, and she took care of me with love. We also spent time playing halma together — our favorite game since childhood. Those moments feel timeless, but I hope we can create more memories together after Amah recovers. It kept haunting me while I’m on my way to the hospital.
  </p>

  <p>
    A short time later, I arrived. I ran as fast as I could toward Amah’s room, accidentally bumping into people passing by in the hallway, but I had no time to deal with it. I kept searching for her room, but I caught a glimpse of a room at the end of the corridor. It’s Amah’s room!
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time I reached the door, I backed away when I saw Amah lying on the bed inside through the small hole in the door. Tears I had been holding back began to flow as I watched the doctors trying to save her. Guilt washed over me, but I knew I couldn't run from this reality any longer. I pushed the door wider with a trembling hand. Sorrow and prayer were offered as everyone bid farewell to Amah. Her face was pale, but peaceful — with a little smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went over to her and, holding her cold hand, I whispered,  
    <br>"Amah, you're not sick anymore. May Amah be at peace up there. Thank you for all the memories that we’ve made. Rest in peace, Dear Amah."
