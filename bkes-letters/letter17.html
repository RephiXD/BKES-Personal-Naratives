  <h1>A Glass of Matcha</h1>

  <p>
    I need a glass of matcha right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before ordering J.Co’s “Green Tea Frappe” in one of the malls in Jakarta, I had a tryout session in the morning. If I get a good score, I’m quite sure that I’ll make the cut for next year’s public university entrance test.
  </p>

  <p>
    40 minutes in and I’ve answered 40 questions. The rest of the test was followed by endless flipping of test pages as I tried to solve the other 40 questions. The sound of pencil tips rubbing the paper’s surface didn’t stop until the bell rang. In the end, the unanswered questions haunted my thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was just a tryout, but hopelessness lingered around my skin. I don't want to feel this way. Not until I realized that it was all too late. I don’t want to fail, not now, not in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sitting there by the transparent glass window, I thought with doubts filling the spaces of my heart. I hope it’s not that bad. What if it’s that bad?
  </p>

  <p>
    Feeling the air thickening around me, I shifted my sights to the cafe’s interiors in hopes of diverting my thoughts to something else.
  </p>

  <p>
    I gazed at the counter, wondering the whereabouts of my “Green Tea Frappe” I ordered a few minutes ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    I always drink matcha whenever a problem slips its way into my head. Right now, I truly need it. Maybe matcha is the only thing that can ensure the sanity of my mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The jazz music keeps on playing, the sound of a coffee-making machine whirring fills the room, the chatter and ear-piercing laughter of people surround me. My chest tightened as if the room was shrinking around me. The world moves while I’m stuck with my mind and its problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t know how long I’d sat solemnly until a waiter tapped my shoulder and handed me my matcha. As the smell of matcha entered my nose, I remembered my mom.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mom is the reason why I love matcha.
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember when I struggled with my final middle school project, she brewed me a glass of matcha. Maybe it’s her way of telling me that I’ll make it. A way to tell me that everything will be fine.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mom is like a glass of matcha. Bitterness is the main flavor, but the hint of sweetness never fails to soothe the mind. Just like matcha, she’s always positive no matter how hard life gets.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mom took the same entrance test 30 years ago. It was a miracle for her. Her family was poor. She had no money to study further after graduating high school. She couldn’t even buy the test paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I was a child, she told me a piece of her life. “I always spent the day in the library, reading and studying. I wanted to study more, but I had to put my family first. I needed to find a job,” said my mom with her glassy eyes staring at me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then she said, “But I had a friend. A kind one. She wanted me to take the test, so she bought two test papers. One for her and one for me,” with a beaming smile on her face.
  </p>

  <p>
    She passed the test and graduated with a bachelor's degree.
  </p>

  <p>
    “From that moment on, I believe that no matter what, everything will be fine,” she said smiling as she ended her story.
  </p>

  <p>
    I thought about my mom while sipping my frappe. Then, I took another sip.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’ll be fine. I thought as I smiled at my half-empty matcha frappe.
