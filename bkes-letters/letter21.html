  <h1>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</h1>

  <p>
    There’s a solace in spotting stars in the sky, probably because I’ve always lived in a polluted city. Being able to stargaze — although I only counted up to 50 stars the most — gives me a slight bit of reassurance that there’s still serendipity. Maybe some things are not all that bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    My best friend and I were once connected like binary stars. But here we are now, wandering into new constellations, heavily drifting further apart.
  </p>

  <p>
    We used to stay up until 3 a.m., just talking about anything and everything. She’d text me about her day, her crushes, her situationship, or even the smallest details that fiddled with her life — like how her house ran out of bread and cheese which would put her in a bad mood. There was never such a thing as ‘too much information’ between us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, until then.
  </p>

  <p>
    “So… We’ve been dating… For a month now.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The words hang oddly in the atmosphere — hefty and peculiar.
  </p>

  <p>
    A month?
  </p>

  <p>
    I feel my face trying to keep the smile muscles intact — barely. I know I should be happy, but the emotion seems far from my chest.
  </p>

  <p>
    I lean my back against the hardwood seat, which only adds to the unease that’s gobbling me up. I look towards the trash can sitting near us, then to the tea and Eggo waffles we just bought, and then back to the plastics that pile up roughly in the bin. All in an attempt to make my eyes seem busy so it doesn’t look like I care whether she was going to tell me sooner or later. But I can’t stow away from all the questions running inside my small yet boisterous mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why didn’t she tell me sooner? What else is she holding back from me? Am I not her best friend anymore?
  </p>

  <p>
    My gut knew something shifted ever since she stopped texting me back right away. Our talks, once filled with fully capitalized greetings, had shrunk into short text messages — which only came hours later.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s like staring at the brightest star in the sky, Sirius A. So dazzling from a distance, yet annoyingly far. The bright bluish star does burn bright, but even the brightest stars will fade once they drift too far away.
  </p>

  <p>
    I walk down to my apartment’s playground carrying a heavy heart that’s gradually sinking me in. But the clock’s arrow shifts above 6 p.m., and my head immediately tilts up — it has become a routine. I aim to fix my eyes on a point in the dark, sort-of-purplish sky. The pupils of my eyes dilate as soon as the corners of my lips widen to the ears when I locate a brilliant point of light casting a gleam across my eyes, vanishing my consternations away.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, as I gaze deeper, another star flickers faintly into view, like it’s racing to earn my interest. Then another. And another. How stunning. A cosmic wave of pure joy flushes over my dark brown eyes, filling me with twinkles of wonder and a peace of mind. As if the atmosphere is revealing its secret, the soft sparkles slowly thread together, forming the shape of Canis Major — a constellation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sure, Sirius A glows the brightest at night. But when I glance at more stars and constellations unfolding around it, I begin to perceive that it’s not the only source of light in the world. There are other stars too, patiently waiting, ready to light up my sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    I guess it’s not all that bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even the night sky is vast enough to shelter more than one star. Thus, so is my life.
